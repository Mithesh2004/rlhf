**ACUTE AORTIC SYNDROME**
ICD-10-M31.4

**ACUTE AORTIC SYNDROME**

Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a term used to describe a constellation of life - threatening aortic diseases that have
similar presentation, but appear to have distinct demographic, clinical, pathological and survival characteristics

**ACUTE AORTIC SYNDROME (AAS)**

**Aortic Dissection (AD)**
Commonest and Most lethal
Tear in the aortic intima and
blood enters into the media
separating the layers
**Intramural Hematoma (IMH)**
Hematoma within the medial layer
of the aortic wall without intimal
injury
**Penetrating Aortic Ulcer (PAU)**
Ulcer-like lesion in the intima eroding
through the media of the aortic wall and
forming localized hematoma thereoff

FL: False Lumen
TL: True Lumen

Formation of Entrance Tear
Rupture of Vasa Vasorum
Ulceration of atherosclerotic plaque

## AORTIC DISSECTION: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Blood enters through the intimal tear and separates
the intima from the media and or adventitia. This
creates an additional false lumen in the layers of aorta
Dissection can proceed antegrade or retrograde
The aorta gets weakened and can rupture causing
cardiac tamponade or hemothorax, shock and even
death
Dissection can compromise the aortic true lumen and
side branches causing various malperfusion
syndromes such as myocardial ischemia, cerebral
ischemia, spinal cord ischemia, mesenteric, renal and
limb ischemia
If the dissection involves aortic root it may cause acute
aortic valve insufficiency
If a patient survives acute episode, the false lumen
may either get thrombosed or may dilate
aneurysmally
Two factors are primarily responsible for pathogenesis
of dissection
*   Higher wall stress due to hypertension or dilatation
    of aorta
*   Inherently weak/degenerated aortic media
Predisposing factors
*   The commonest risk factor is hypertension.
*   Genetically mediated aortopathies like
    **Marfan's syndrome**
*   **Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome**
*   Bicuspid aortic valve
*   Familial aortic dissection
*   Trauma and iatrogenic injury are also emerging as
    important causes of aortic dissection

## CLASSIFICATION
A. Chronological Classification: Depending upon the presentation from the
onset of pain
*   Acute dissection: within 14 days
*   Subacute dissection: between 15 and 90 days
*   Chronic dissection: more than 90 days
B. Anatomical Classification: Stanford Classification is the most commonly
used classification. Two types based on involvement of intrapericardial
aorta (ascending aorta and aortic root)

**Type A:**
Dissection involves
the intrapericardial
aorta regardless of
the site of intimal tear.
It is also known as
Proximal dissection

**Type B:**
Dissection does not
involve the
intrapericardial aorta.
It is also known as
Distal dissection

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND COMPLICATIONS
Abrupt onset of severe chest and/or back pain is the most typical feature.
The pain is sharp, ripping, tearing, knife-like, and typically different from other
causes of chest pain.
Anterior chest pain is more common in acute Type A dissection, whereas back
or abdominal pain is more common with Type B dissection.
The pain may migrate from its point of origin to other sites, following the
dissection path
Other manifestations may include
*   **Shock**
*   **Syncope**
*   Neurological deficit including **stroke**
    and **paraplegia**
*   Acute congestive heart failure
*   Myocardial ischemia
*   Lower extremity ischemia
*   Renal and visceral
    ischemia
*   Sudden death

## MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION VS ACUTE TYPE A DISSECTION
Clinically, a dissection-related coronary malperfusion may present with ECG
changes of primary myocardial ischemia or infarction. This may increase the
likelihood of misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapeutic intervention
Before starting the treatment algorithm for myocardial ischemia, it is important
to differentiate between a primary coronary event and coronary malperfusion
secondary to dissection process
In dissection, pain is usually abrupt, piercing, and well localized. Presence of
diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation, unequal pulses, limb ischemia or
neurological complications favor the diagnosis of acute dissection
If dissection is diagnosed with myocardial ischemia it should be managed on
the line of dissection and thrombolytic therapy should NOT be initiated

## IMAGING AND DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM
Combination of ECG, Chest X-ray, Echocardiography and ECG gated CT angiography provides desired information.
If clinical examination or CT angiography suggests involvement of innominate artery, common carotid arteries,
subclavian arteries, and iliac arteries, an additional vascular ultrasound examination is performed. Conventional
catheter based coronary angiogram and aortogram are not needed in diagnostic work up of acute dissection
In a stable patient with low index of suspicion of dissection, D-dimers can be assessed. Normal levels of D-dimers
virtually rule out dissection. However, IMH and PAU may still be present. In dissection, the level of D-dimers is
immediately very high, compared with other disorders in which the D-dimers level increases gradually

If Acute Aortic
Syndrome is
suspected kindly
refer the patient
to higher center
