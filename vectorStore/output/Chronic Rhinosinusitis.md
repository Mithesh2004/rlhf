# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS
ICD 10-J32.9

## WHEN TO SUSPECT?
If symptoms persist
for more than 12
weeks:
*   nasal obstruction/
    nasal discharge and
    facial pain/reduced
    sense of smell

## RULE OUT FOLLOWING PRECIPITATING/ EXACERBATING CONDITIONS
*   Occupational
    exposure to irritants/
    pollutants (refer to
    hyperlink)
*   Allergic rhinitis, aspirin
    sensitivity, asthma,
    laryngopharyngeal
    reflux, smoking
*   Adenoid hypertrophy,
    bottle feeding, passive
    smoking in children
*   Medications and
    hormones associated
    with nasal congestion
    (NSAIDS,
    antihypertensive,
    psychotropic drugs,
    prolonged use of
    topical nasal
    decongestants)

## RED FLAG
*   Frontal
    swelling
*   Orbital symptoms
    *   Periorbital edema/ erythema
    *   Displaced globe
    *   Double or reduced vision (loss of
        green-red color differentiation may
        be the first sign)
    *   Ophthalmoplegia
*   Signs of meningitis/
    intracranial
    complications
    *   Fever with headache
    *   Neck stiffness
    *   Photophobia
    *   Altered sensorium
    *   Vomiting
*   Known diabetic/AIDS/
    immunosuppressive
    medications (suspect
    invasive fungal sinusitis)

## EXAMINE THE NOSE FOR NASAL POLYPI TWO PHENOTYPES
*   Chronic sinusitis with nasal polypi (CRSWNP)
*   Chronic sinusitis without nasal polypi (CRSSNP)

## TREATMENT OF CRS
*   Mild/moderate symptoms (no significant congestion/ discharge/
    polypi/complications)
    1. Address etiology and exacerbating factors.
    2. For allergic rhinitis, antihistamines and nasal steroid spray to be
    given.
    3. Saline nasal wash
    4. Steam inhalation
    5. Stretching exercises and yoga are
    6. Topical associated with cardiovascular
    7. Intra nasal steroid sprays for 6-8weeks (Fluticasone proprionate/
       Fluticasone furoate/ Mometasone) after discussing risk - benefit -
       cost issues with patient regarding steroid sprays
       If no symptomatic relief to above treatment, perform nasal endoscopy
       and consider NCCT of paranasal sinuses
*   In presence of nasal purulent discharge
    1. Culture directed antibiotics to be considered
    2. If culture is negative, empirical antibiotics (Amoxycillin/
       Coamoxyclav/ Fluoroquinolone/ Roxithromycin) to be given for at
       least 2weeks.
    3. Upper dental (particularly 1st molar) infection may cause maxillary
       sinusitis which is to be treated with metronidazole.
*   In the presence of nasal polypi, initial nasal steroid spray and subsequent
    endoscopic surgery is to be planned.
    1. Short course of oral steroid (Prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg for 5 - 10 days)
       provides temporary relief in nasal obstruction in extensive polypi.
    2. Steroid therapy is not a replacement for surgery.

## IN ALL PATIENTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE PRESENCE OF NASAL POLYPI, RULE OUT ALLERGY/ALLERGIC RHINITIS
1. Consider allergen
avoidance
2. Skin prick test
3. Co-existing bronchial
asthma needs to be
treated
4. Consider AIT if indicated.

## TREATMENT OUTCOMES
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identification of precipitating or exacerbating factors is the key to successful treatment outcome. | Always rule out DNS/nasal polypi in CRS, as surgical treatment may be necessary for complete resolution of symptoms. | Ensure adherence to nasal saline washes / regular physical activity/ medications. | Educate patients on correct technique of using steroid nasal sprays and nasal irrigation. | Prolonged use of topical nasal decongestant beyond 5-7 days may cause rebound congestion and rhinitis medicamentosa and to be strongly discouraged. |
