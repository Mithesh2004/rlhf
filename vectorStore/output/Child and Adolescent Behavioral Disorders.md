## MANAGEMENT

### DIAGNOSIS

*   Attempt further classification into ADHD, ODD and CD (ADHD may be present with or without ODD and CD

### CAUTION

*   Abrupt onset
*   Recent onset (few weeks to few months)
*   Sudden increase in severity (consider another psychiatric disorder such as **bipolar affective disorder, hypomanic or manic episode -> follow the relevant STW**)

### WORK WITH FAMILY

*   Engage with child in mutually enjoyable, pleasurable activities (playing games, discussing interesting things or doing activities together)
*   Set clear do's and don'ts and explain to child in clear, simple, short instructions the consequencies (like withholding privileges following misbehavior; use star-charting (contingency management) and rewards based on number of stars earned

*   Extra coaching, if needed in case of learning problems

### MEDICATION (AVOID BEFORE 5 YEARS)
*   Severe and persistant aggression:
    *   T. Risperidone under close supervision (starting dose-0.25 mg, single daily morning dose after breakfast. Based on response, increase by 0.25 mg weekly up to 1 mg single daily dose).
    *   Not to exceed 1 mg/day
    *   Response +: continue 3 months f/b slow taper
    *   Response - : 4 weeks trial, then refer

Severe, complicated presentation Lack of response to treatment Severe aggression Highly dysfunctional family Alcohol and substance abuse
