# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 1
ICD-10-E10

## SYMPTOMS
*   Polydipsia
*   Polyuria / Nocturia
*   Polyphagia
*   Weight loss
*   Short duration of complaints
*   Diabetic ketoacidosis as first presentation

## DIAGNOSIS
*   Diagnosis of diabetes: **Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg%**; **post-glucose ≥ 200 mg%**; **HbA1c ≥ 6.5%** (all to be re-confirmed); **random glucose ≥ 200 mg%** with symptoms
*   Characteristic of T1 diabetes; **urine/blood ketones:** moderate-large (in > 50%)
*   Continuous requirement for **insulin** since diagnosis

## INVESTIGATIONS
*   **HbA1c, creatinine, hemoglobin, TSH, tTG (tissue transglutaminase) antibody, lipid profile**

## AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT

### NUTRITION
*   Calories should be appropriate to the expected body weight, pubertal status, activity
*   Balanced diet including all food groups
*   Simple sugars and excessive fats to be avoided
*   Meals/snacks to be individualized and reflect insulin schedule (usually 3 meals, 2 snacks)

### REGULAR EXERCISE
*   Beneficial and should be encouraged

### EDUCATION
*   Emphasize diabetes related education to patient and caregivers

### SMBG
*   Check before each meal and at bedtime
*   Should be checked more frequently in case **A1c** is not controlled, frequent **hypoglycemia**
*   Glucose at midnight (12.00-2.00 am) occasionally to rule out nocturnal **hypoglycemia**
*   Ketones should be checked if blood glucose is > 250 mg/dl

### TARGET
*   Pre-meal 80-130 mg% 
*   2 hours post-meal: 120-180 mg%

## INSULIN TREATMENT

### Basal and bolus regimen
*   **Insulin** administration (0.25 to 1.0U/kg depending on age and pubertal status)
    *   Basal: **glargine** or **detemir** or **NPH** 40-50% of daily requirement
    *   Bolus: regular or rapid acting 50% of daily requirement/3 injections before each meal
*   **Insulin** doses can be adjusted depending upon
    *   1. Pre-meal and post-meal glucose level
    *   2.Carbohydrates in the meal
    *   3.Excercise pattern

## REASONS FOR REFERRAL TO HIGHER CENTRES
*   Uncontrolled hyperglycemia
*   For education of patient & family
*   For **insulin** injection techniques/ SBGM/ identifying **hypoglycemia** s/s
*   Recurrent **hypoglycemia**
*   Severe diabetic ketoacidosis (altered sensorium, rapid breathing)
*   Chronic diabetes specific complications

## MONITORING
### EVERY THREE MONTHS
*   Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
*   Target: <7% (should be individualized)

### COMPLICATIONS & COMORBIDITIES (5 YEARS AFTER DIAGNOSIS, THEN ANNUALLY)
*   Fundus examination (Retinopathy)
*   Foot examination (Neuropathy)
*   Urine albumin/creatinine ratio
*   Other investigations (S-creatinine, TSH), lipid profile

## SICK DAY RULES/DKA HYPOGLYCAEMIA

### IN CASE OF SICKNESS / INFECTION
*   Measure glucose frequently, check for urine ketones if glucose >250 mg%
*   Drink plenty of fluids, monitor urine output
*   Eat small light meals 4-5 times/day
*   In addition to usual **insulin** doses, take extra regular **insulin** s.c. every 6 hourly (10-15% of total daily **insulin** dose)
*   If glucose not falling, excess vomiting, low urine output, high or rising ketone, admit the patient

### DKA MANAGEMENT
*   As per STW on Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

### HYPOGLYCAEMIA
*   Symptoms and signs: Sweating, hunger, tremors, irritability, weakness, drowsiness / seizures / unconsciousness (late stage)
*   Diagnosis: Mild / moderate: glucose <70 mg% with or without symptoms
*   Severe **hypoglycemia**: coma / seizures / inability to treat oneself
*   Treatment: If glucose <70 mg% take 3 tsf glucose powder or sugar; if severe: caregiver should give inj. glucagon 1 mg s.c./ i.m. OTHERWISE IMMEDIATELY take to hospital for intravenous glucose injection (1-2 ml/kg of 25% dextrose)
*   Prevention: Identify mismatch of food, exercise, **insulin**

## AT EVERY VISIT
*   Growth & pubertal development (for children and adolescents)
*   Dietary and medication compliance
*   BP, Weight monitoring
*   Insulin site and injection technique
*   Review SMBG record
*   Hypoglycemia

## ABBREVIATIONS
*   BP: Blood pressure
*   DKA: Diabetic ketoacidosis
*   SBMG: Self-monitoring of blood glucose
*   TSH: Thyroid-stimulating hormone
*   tTG: Tissue transglutaminase
