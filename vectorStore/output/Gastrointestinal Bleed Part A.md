**RED STOOLS**
**BLACK STOOLS**

ASSESS FOR HIGH RISK
(Classify as high risk if any of these are present)
*   Pulse rate >100/min
*   Systolic BP <90 mmHg
*   H/O Syncope
*   Oxygen saturation <90%
*   Altered sensorium
*   Age >60 years
    and/or significant
    co-morbid conditions

RESUSCITATE
*   Place atleast one IV cannula
    (minimum 18 G) and start crystalloids
    (Ringer's lactate or normal saline)

*   Place a NG tube and
    perform lavage

*   Start supplemental oxygen at 2 L/min
    in high risk cases and those in shock

*   Stop antiplatelets and anticoagulants.
    If H/o recent myocardial infarction or
    stent placed, consult a cardiologist

*   Refer all high risk cases after initial
    resuscitation

TARGETS
*   Pulse rate <100/min
*   Systolic BP >90 mmHg
*   Oxygen saturation >90%

*   Hemoglobin >7 g/dL
    (in case of heart
    disease >9g/dL)

### CLINICAL EVALUATION

| Assess for       | History and examination                        | Points towards        |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Site of bleed    | Hematemesis/ blood in NG tube/ melena          | Upper Gl bleed        |
|                  | Fresh blood per rectum/maroon stools           | Lower/Upper Gl bleed  |
| Etiology         | H/o - alcohol intake/jaundice/ blood transfusion O/E - jaundice/ascites/splenomegaly | Variceal bleed        |
|                  | H/o epigastric pain/ NSAID intake/ antiplatelets | Ulcer bleed           |
|                  | If lower GI Bleed: H/o fever/diarrhea           | Infective causes (eg: Typhoid) |
| Rate of blood loss | H/o bleeding per rectum with concomitant yellow stools | Hemorrhoids/ rectal lesion |
|                  | Large volume hematemesis/ fresh blood/frequent melena/postural giddiness/ breathlessness/ hypotension | Rapid blood loss     |
| Precipitants     | Aspirin/ NSAIDs/ antiplatelets/anticoagulants   | Stop all precipitants |
| Co-morbid conditions | Cardiovascular disease/ renal disease/ malignancy | Assess functional status |

### MANAGEMENT

*   Continue resuscitation
    (As detailed above)

*   Blood transfusion
    Give packed RBC/ whole blood if Hb <7 g/dL
    (or Hb <9 g/dL in case pre-existing heart
    disease)

*   Patient may need ICU care depending on
    the overall general condition. If patient is in
    altered sensorium and bleeding actively
    secure airway

### PHARMACOTHERAPY

| Diagnosis          | Class of drugs  | Administration regimen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Stop if variceal bleed is documented                                                                                                 |

Somatostatin 250 µg I.V. stat, followed by 250 µg/hr infusion X 3-5 days OR Inj. Octreotide 50 µg stat I.V. followed by 50 µg/hr infusion X 3-5 days Avoid Terlipressin in patients with suspected heart disease or peripheral vascular disease.          |
|                    |                 | if patient is on Terlipressin examine for signs of peripheral/ cardiac ischemia regularly                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### INVESTIGATIONS

*   Hemoglobin,
    platelets, TLC, PTL, INR

*   Blood grouping and
    cross matching to
    arrange blood

*   Desirable Tests:
    Prothrombin time/ INR,
    liver function tests,
    blood urea and
    creatinine,
    HBsAg, Anti HCV
    ultrasound abdomen

All cases of acute GI Bleed must undergo endoscopy within 24 hours of initial stabilisation.
Patients with active ongoing bleed may require an earlier endoscopy.
Appropriate informed consent to be taken prior to endoscopy.
