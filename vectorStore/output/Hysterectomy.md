# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for
HYSTERECTOMY FOR BENIGN GYNAECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS

IN WOMEN AGED LESS THAN 40 AND/OR LOW PARITY IT IS MANDATORY TO HAVE A SECOND
OPINION FROM A QUALIFIED GYNAECOLOGIST

HYSTERECTOMY TO BE CONSIDERED ONLY WHEN CHILD BEARING IS COMPLETED & RARELY IN YOUNGER PATIENTS

## INDICATIONS:

```
* **LEIOMYOMA**
    * Symptomatic fibroids especially if not responding to medical management
    * Asymptomatic fibroids greater than or equal to 14 weeks uterine size
    * Fibroid causing **hydroureteronephrosis**
    * Rapidly enlarging fibroids
    * Submucus myoma greater than 4cm
* **HEAVY MENSTRUAL BLEEDING**
    * Failed medical treatment
* **ENDOMETRIOSIS**
    * Failed medical treatment
    * Causing **hydroureteronephrosis**
    * Recurrence after failed medical/conservative surgical management
* **PROLAPSE**
    * Third or fourth degree **utero vaginal prolapse**
* **PRE - INVASIVE DISEASES**
    * Endometrial hyperplasia without atypia with failed medical treatment
    * Endometrial hyperplasia with atypia
    * CIN II with poor compliance or CIN III
* **OTHERS**
    * Adnexal masses: Need for hysterectomy to be individualised and justified
    * Recurrent post-menopausal bleeding (even in the absence of malignancy)

Simple ovarian cysts less than 5 cm in size and without other significant/suspicious features
should be kept on observation and reviewed after 6 months

## ROUTES OF HYSTERECTOMY
* ABDOMINAL
* VAGINAL
    * Pelvic organ prolapse
    * Non descent hysterectomy
* LAPAROSCOPIC
    * In appropriately selected patients

## HYSTERECTOMY SHOULD NOT BE DONE FOR
* White discharge per vaginum
* Cervicitis
* Non specific abdominal or pelvic pain
* Minor degree of utero vaginal prolapse
* Fibroids which are small (less than 5 cm) or Asymptomatic (less than12 weeks size uterus)
* Simple ovarian cyst less than or equal to 5 cm

## COMPONENTS OF PRE OPERATIVE COUNSELLING AND INFORMED CONSENT
* Need for **hysterectomy**
* Alternative treatment options
* Risks and benefits
* Potential complications of the procedure
* Removal/conservation of ovaries & tubes
* Route of hysterectomy
* Possible need for post operative Hormone therapy in selected cases

## INVESTIGATIONS
* Complete Blood Count
* Blood grouping & cross matching
* Fasting Blood Sugar & Post Prandial Blood Sugar
* Renal Function Test
* Liver Function Test
* Urine Routine & Microscopy
* Electrocardiogram
* X ray chest
* Others as indicated

## COMPLICATIONS TO BE EXPLAINED
* Risk of Infection
* Bleeding (primary/ reactionary/ secondary)
* Injury to bladder/ bowel/ ureter
* Pain
* Fever
* Hernia (rare and late complication)

## FOLLOW UP
* Discharge summary with operative details
* Review for **histopathology** report
* Report if there is fever, bleeding or any other symptoms
* Avoid lifting heavy weight for 8 weeks
* Abstinence for eight weeks
* Adequate iron and calcium & Vitamin D3 supplements
* Evaluate need for hormones in very selected patients

Ovaries should be preserved in most pre-menopausal women unless diseased.
While doing hysterectomy for benign gynaecological conditions in pre-menopausal women, it is recommended to combine it with
bilateral salpingectomy with a view to minimise the risk of subsequent development of ovarian malignancy1.2

COUNSELLING IS AN IMPORTANT ADJUNCT TO MANAGEMENT
KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES
