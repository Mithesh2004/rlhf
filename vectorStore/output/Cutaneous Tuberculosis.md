# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**CUTANEOUS TUBERCULOSIS**
ICD-A18.4

## ETIOLOGY
*   M.tuberculosis
*   M.bovis
*   NTM
*   BCG (rarely)

## WHEN TO SUSPECT
*   Presence of ulcer or discharging sinus over lymph node, bone & joints
*   Persistent asymptomatic reddish/ reddish brown lesion of >6 months duration which may show scarring
*   Persistent warty or verrucous lesion of >6 months duration

## OTHER FEATURES
*   Extracutaneous involvement
*   Lymph node & lungs involvement
*   Other organ systems involvement (bones, GIT & CNS)

## TYPES OF CLINICAL DISEASE
*   **Primary Inoculation tuberculosis**
*   **Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis**
*   **Lupus vulgaris**
*   **Scrofuloderma**
*   **Acute miliary tuberculosis**
*   **Orificial tuberculosis**
*   Metastatic tuberculous
*   **Abscess (tuberculousgumma)**
*   Normal primary complex-like reaction
*   Postvaccination
*   Perforating regional adenitis
*   **Lichen scrofulosorum**
*   **Papulonecrotictuberculid**
*   Facultative tuberculids
*   Nodular vasculitis & Erythema nodosum

Lupus Vulgaris

## INVESTIGATION
### INVESTIGATIONS
*   **Histopathology**: Granulomas with epithelioid histiocytes & Langerhans - type giant cells
*   FNAC: If indicated
*   IGRA/PCR: Not
    recommended for diagnosis

### SCREENING FOR SYSTEMIC INVOLVEMENT
*   Examination:
    *   Lymph node to be examined (FNAC)
    *   Other organ system can be done if indicated
*   Essential:
    *   Chest X-ray
    *   FNAC from the indurated part of lesion
*   Desirable:
    *   Histopathology
    *   Culture from biopsy sample (Not swab)

### CASE DEFINITION
A) Confirmed case:
*   **M.tuberculosis complex** identified by either culture or NAAT or histology shows typical morphology
*   Full course of ATT which led to complete clearance of lesions
B) Probable case:
    *   Typical skin lesion with no positive features/investigation as mentioned above (A)

## DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM
Suspected TB case based on presence of clinical signs
*   Ulcers/discharging sinuses over sites of LN, bones & joints
*   Persistent, asymptomatic raised reddish/reddish brown lesion of >6 months' which may show scarring at one end
*   Persistent, warty skin lesion of >6 months'

```

Refer to dermatologist with expertise in cutaneous TB

*   **Strong clinical suspicion**
    *   Start ATT

*FNAC can be done if facilities for skin biopsy are not available

## MANAGEMENT

### TREATMENT
*   Similar to Pulmonary TB as per NTEP
*   DR -TB to be kept in mind
*   No role of steroids, oral or topical, in management of CT

### FOLLOW UP
*   1st follow-up after 4-6 weeks; majority improves
*   If no response after 8 weeks
*   Alternate diagnosis/DR-TB; refer to higher centre
