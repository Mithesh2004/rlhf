# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## VARICELLA & HERPES ZOSTER
ICD-10-B01-02

## VARICELLA (CHICKEN POX)

### WHEN TO SUSPECT?
*   Fever, malaise
*   Generalized vesicular lesions on erythematous base (dew drop
    on a rose petal sign)
*   Skin lesions in different stages of evolution: erythematous
    macules, papules, vesicles and crusted lesions

### TAKE HISTORY OF
*   Recent contact with a patient with varicella
*   Past history of varicella/varicella vaccination
*   Immunosuppression (especially if second episode of varicella):
    malignancy, HIV/AIDS, transplant recipient

### PREGNANCY AND VARICELLA
*   Infection in 1st 20 weeks may lead to congenital varicella
    syndrome
*   Treat with acyclovir
*   Maternal perinatal varicella may lead to neonatal varicella;
    initiate treatment and refer to a specialist

### RED FLAG SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
*   Hemorrhagic vesicles
*   Difficulty in breathing
*   Chest pain
*   Abdominal pain
*   Stiff neck, confused behaviour (CNS symptoms)
*   Hemodynamic instability

### INVESTIGATIONS
*   As per availability and need:
*   Tzanck smear: from a fresh vesicle- will show
    multinucleate giant cells and acantholysis
*   Symptom directed: Chest X-ray, ECG, ECHO,
    transaminases, renal function test, brain imaging
*   Optional
*   VZV PCR - skin swab
*   Skin biopsy

### TREATMENT
*   General measures
*   Isolate the patient from high risk contacts
*   Daily bath with soap
*   Antipyretics: Paracetamol; avoid aspirin as it is associated
    with Reye's syndrome in children
*   Antihistamines
*   Specific treatment*
*   Adults/children >40kg: Oral **Acyclovir**- **800mg**, 5 times a
    day for 5-7 days
*   Children <40kg: **(20mg/kg/dose)** max **800mg** four times
    a day for 7 days
*   Alternative (if available): **Valacyclovir** (adults-**1g** TDS)
*   Give intravenous **Acyclovir (10mg/kg/dose** 8 hourly) if:
    *   Systemic complications
    *   Hemorrhagic varicella
    *   Immunosuppressed patient
    *   Neonatal Varicella (higher dose may be required)

    *Infants, children >12 years of age, adults, pregnant women and immunosuppressed patients
    should be treated with specific anti-viral medication because of risk of severe varicella
    *Maximum benefit if acyclovir initiated 24 hours of onset of rash

### COMPLICATIONS
*   Secondary skin infections
*   Pneumonia
*   Encephalitis
*   Hepatitis
*   Pancreatitis
*   Myocarditis
*   Reye's syndrome

### WHEN TO REFER TO A HIGHER CENTRE
*   Diagnosis in doubt
*   Systemic complications
*   Hemodynamic instability
*   Hemorrhagic varicella
*   Not responding to oral Acyclovir
*   Immunosuppressed patient
*   Neonatal varicella syndrome

### PREVENTION
VARICELLA
*   Active immunization (live vaccine)
    *   <13 years old: 1st dose at 12-15
        months, 2nd dose at 4-6 years
    *   >=13 years old: 2 doses weeks apart
*   Passive immunization
    *   Varicella zoster immunoglobulin may be considered
        where active immunization is contraindicated (pregnant
        women, immunosuppressed patients)

## HERPES ZOSTER

### WHEN TO SUSPECT?
*   Acute, grouped, vesiculo-pustular eruption in a
    dermatomal distribution
*   Dermatomal pain

### TAKE HISTORY OF
*   Previous varicella
*   Previous episode of herpes zoster
*   Immunosuppression: Diabetes mellitus, malignancy,
    transplant recipient, HIV

### RED FLAG SIGNS
*   V1 dermatomal involvement: forehead, periorbital,
    nose tip: risk of eye involvement - look for watering of
    eye, redness, photophobia
*   Lesions on the ear or inside the ear canal: risk of
    facial/vestibulocochlear nerve palsy - look for vertigo,
    tinnitus, hearing loss, facial asymmetry/weakness
*   Multi-dermatomal involvement
*   Disseminated herpes zoster
*   Hemorrhagic/necrotic lesions

### INVESTIGATIONS
Diagnosis is usually clinical
*   Tzanck smear: from a fresh vesicle- will show
    multinucleate giant cells and acantholysis
*   Optional
*   PCR from vesicular fluid

### TREATMENT
*   Analgesics: Acute pain relief with NSAIDs.
*   If uncontrolled, add the following (step wise):
    *   a) **Pregabalin 150-600mg/day**, start with **150mg HS** and
        titrate up as required
    *   b) Gabapentin: start with **300mg/day**, gradually increase
        upto **1800mg/day**; more adverse effects than
        pregabalin
    *   c) Amitriptyline: **10-25mg HS**
    *   d) Nortryptyline: start with **10-25mg/day**; gradual increase
        upto **30-75mg/day** in divided doses or HS
    *   e) Carbamazepine **200 mg HS** to start with
*   Specific treatment*
    *   Acyclovir **800mg** five times a day x 7 days or
    *   Valacyclovir 1gm three times a day x 7 days

    *Start <72 hours of onset for maximum benefit, can consider if new lesions are still
    appearing after 72 hours/ Herpes Zoster ophthalmicus/Ramsay Hunt syndrome
    **Intravenous Acyclovir if multi-segmental involvement or disseminated zoster or
    systemic complications

### COMPLICATIONS
*   Secondary skin infections
*   Herpes zoster ophthalmicus: risk when lesions present over
    side/tip of nose (Hutchinson's sign)
*   Ramsay Hunt syndrome: Facial nerve palsy (with vesicles in
    the ear canal)
*   Aseptic meningitis, encephalitis: In elderly and
    immunosuppressed mainly
*   Post-herpetic neuralgia (pain persistent for more than three
    months, common in elderly)

### WHEN TO REFER TO A HIGHER CENTRE
*   Multi-dermatomal distribution/disseminated Herpes
    Zoster syndrome
*   Systemic complications
*   Facial nerve palsy
*   Eye involvement
*   Neurological involvement
*   Post-herpetic neuralgia

HERPES ZOSTER
*   Active immunization may be
    offered to patients >50 years old,
    irrespective of previous history of
    herpes zoster

INITIATE SPECIFIC ANTIVIRAL TREATMENT AT THE EARLIEST TO PREVENT COMPLICATIONS
