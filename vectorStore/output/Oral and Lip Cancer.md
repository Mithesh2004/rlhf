# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## LIP AND ORAL CANCER
ICD-10-C 06.9

*   Tobacco
*   Alcohol
*   Areca nut
*   Sharp tooth
*   III-fitting
    dentures

### Non healing ulcer/sore in the mouth especially in a tobacco chewer or smoker

### Neck mass

### Difficulty in opening mouth

### Difficulty in protrusion of tongue

### Pain referred to ear

### Oral premalignant disorders (OPMD): leukoplakia/ erythroplakia/sub mucous fibrosis, lichen planus

### Screening can detect OPMD and invasive cancer early and improve outcome. Treatment of oral cancer is ideally delivered by a **multidisciplinary team (MDT)**

### EVALUATION
*   Clinical examination, +/- examination under anaesthesia (EUA), assess pain, nutritional status, & oro-dental hygiene
*   USG neck / CT scan head & neck
*   Evaluate upper aerodigestive tract for second primary
*   Biopsy from primary site, FNAC from neck node
*   CBC, LFT, RFT, blood sugar, chest X-ray, ECG
*   Tobacco cessation for patient and care givers
*   Pure tone audiometry (PTA)
*   Speech and swallowing assessment
*   Define clinical and radiological staging, goals of treatment

### TREATMENT

## T1 T2, NO CANCER
OPTIONS WITH CURATIVE INTENT

Initial surgery preferred (wide excision with 1 cm margins & supra-omohyoid neck dissection
(Level I - III) with reconstruction
OR
Radical radiation therapy

## T4B N3 (TONGUE AND BUCCAL CANCERS WITH SKULL BASE/INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INVOLVEMENT
AIM OF TREATMENT IS PALLIATION

*   Palliative chemotherapy
*   RT
*   Immunotherapy
*   Best supportive care

## T3 T4A, NO N1 N2
OPTIONS WITH CURATIVE INTENT

Initial surgery: wide excision with 1 cm margins + comprehensive neck dissection and reconstruction
OR
Chemoradiation
OR
Neo-adjuvant CT followed by surgery

### INDICATIONS FOR ADJUVANT RT
Close margin, positive node(s), or presence of any two of following: LVI, PNI, high grade

### INDICATIONS FOR ADJUVANT CT-RT:
Metastatic nodes with extracapsular extension, involved margins

## THE DRUG OF CHOICE FOR CONCURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY IS CISPLATIN

### Adjuvant radiation
The minimum post-operative radiation dose is 60 Gy/6 weeks/30# or equivalent to the primary and nodal areas using conventional treatment planning, 3DCRT or IMRT

### Radical radiation
66-70 Gy is delivered using conventional planning / 3DCRT/IMRT through a telecobalt machine or a LINAC at 1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction over 7-8 weeks (or a biologically equivalent dose) with adequate margins all around the lesion and including level I, II and III nodes

### Large SCC lower Lip
### Intraoperative image following tumor excision
### Postoperative results following reconstruction

### FOLLOW UP
Follow up: 3 monthly for the first 3 years, 6 monthly for years 4 & 5 and annually thereafter with clinical examination at every visit, evaluation of symptoms as they present and endoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract annually

To identify recurrences and second primary cancers

Treatment of common side effects - xerostomia, speech and swallowing issues, nutrition and physical rehabilitation, dental care should be looked after by the members of multidisciplinary team

### Emphasize tobacco cessation for patients
*   Set a quit date, tell your family
*   Remove tobacco / cigarettes from your home, car, and work
*   Tobacco withdrawal symptoms:
    *   Trouble sleeping
    *   Feeling irritable, anxious, or restless
    *   Getting frustrated or angry
    *   Having trouble thinking clearly
Counsellor's help is available to deal with the cravings and triggers
Can combine nicotine replacement with or + bupropion

### ABBREVIATIONS

MDT: Multidisciplinary team
OPMD: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy
PNI: Perineural invasion
PTA: Pure tone audiometry
RFT: Renal function tests
