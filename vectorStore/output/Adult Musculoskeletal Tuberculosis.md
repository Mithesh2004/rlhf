# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of ADULT MUSCULOSKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS

ICD-10-A18.0

## WHEN TO SUSPECT?

### SPINE TUBERCULOSIS
*   Persistent localized pain in spine region >6 weeks, night pains
*   Local tenderness/cold abscess
*   Recent onset deformity in the back
*   Recent neurological deficit (better to refer*)
*   Persistent heaviness around the waist/Girdle pain
*   Fever, cough, weight loss & night pains
*   History of close contact with TB

### OTHER JOINTS/BONES
*   Persistent localized pain & swelling >6 weeks
*   Mono-articular joint involvement
*   Discharging sinus (+/-)
*   Fluctuant swelling with or without inflammation
*   Painful restriction of involved joint movements
*   Wasting around the area
*   Fever, cough, weight loss & night pains
*   History of close contact with TB

## DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM

### Presumptive TB
*   ESR, CRP, LFT, KFT, HIV
*   Imaging: X-rays spine & chest, (MRI, if feasible)

### Features s/o TB

#### Flow Chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[In case of psoas abscess or soft tissue abscess: USG guided biopsy, bone/joint biopsy (open or percutaneous)] --> B{Biopsy facilities not available: Refer};
    B --> C[Lesion not accessible for biopsy: Refer];
    D[Send samples for: Gram staining & Culture sensitivity, AFB staining, HPE, NAAT, Solid & liquid mycobacterium culture, LPA if feasible] --> E{MTB +ve};
    D --> F{MTB -ve};
    E --> G[Start ATT];
    F --> H[Refer to higher centre];
```

### Findings S/o TB
*   X-ray findings(spine):
    *   Regional Osteopenia
    *   Decreased/obliterated disc space
    *   Vertebral erosions +/- reduced vertebral height
    *   Paravertebral shadow
*   MRI findings (Spine):
    *   Contagious VB involvement with relatively preserved disc
    *   Pre & paravertebral septate collection (Abscess)
    *   Epidural encroachment +/- intraosseous abscess
*   X-ray & MRI Finding (extraspinal):
    *   Regional osteoporosis with bone destruction on X-rays
    *   Inflammation of bone(T1WI & T2WI) +/- abscess on MRI

## TREATMENT

Treatment should be started & follow-up should be conducted as per NTEP guidelines
The following algorithm provides additional guidance for follow-up

#### Flow Chart:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[TB +ve on any test] --> B{NAAT sensitive to Rifampicin: Start 4 drug first line ATT};
    A --> C{GeneXpert resistant to Rifampicin: refer*/culture for TB and sensitivity to other drugs};
    D[TB -ve on all tests] --> E{Index of suspicion high ESR, CRP raised: Refer*};
    D --> F{Index of suspicion low CRP normal: Reassurance};
    G[Clinical symptoms improvement] --> H{CRP decreasing continue for standard 12 months regime};
    H --> I{Intensive 4 drug regime (not more than 4 months)};
    I --> J{Stop ATT after 12 months if all three parameters clinical, Lab (ESR, CRP) & radiological return to normal};
    J --> K{In case of spine decision to stop ATT to be taken by evaluating healed status on contrast MRI};
    K --> L{Mildly elevated ESR, CRP (non specific tests) can be ignored};
    L --> M{Follow up every month with CRP, LFT during intensive phase};
    M --> N{Follow up every 3 months during continuation phase with CRP/LFT};
    N --> O{On treatment worsening of symptoms > Early (<3 months): Paradoxical > Late (>4 months): ?drug resistance};
    O --> P{Any aberrance in course such as appearnce of nerual deficit: Refer*};
    D --> Q{Clinical symptoms not improving ESR, CRP increasing: Refer* ?Suspected drug resistance};
```

*   Clinical symptoms improvement
    *   CRP decreasing continue for standard 12 months regime
    *   Intensive 4 drug regime (not more than 4 months)
    *   Stop ATT after 12 months if all three parameters clinical, Lab (ESR, CRP) & radiological return to normal
    *   In case of spine decision to stop ATT to be taken by evaluating healed status on contrast MRI
    *   Mildly elevated ESR, CRP (non specific tests) can be ignored
    *   Follow up every month with CRP, LFT during intensive phase
    *   Follow up every 3 months during continuation phase with CRP/LFT
    *   On treatment worsening of symptoms
        *   Early (<3 months): Paradoxical
        *   Late (>4 months): ?drug resistance
    *   Any aberrance in course such as appearnce of nerual deficit: Refer*

*Refer to higher centre where advanced diagnostic, & therapeutic facilities including surgical procedures are available.
