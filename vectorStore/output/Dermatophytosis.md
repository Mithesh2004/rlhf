# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## DERMATOPHYTOSES
### ICD-10-B35.9

July/2022

DEFINITION
*   Superficial fungal infection caused by **dermatophytes**
*   Affects keratin bearing structures i.e the skin, nails and hair

TINEA CORPORIS/CRURIS
EXAMINATION
*   Itchy scaly lesion on the skin
*   Typically annular (ring like) lesions with variable scaling (flaking) and erythema (redness)
*   Always examine: groins, buttocks, nails, palms and soles
*   Ask for lesions in other family members

ADVISE ALL PATIENTS TO
*   Take treatment regularly as advised and never stop without consultation after obtaining some relief to prevent relapse
*   Do not self medicate. This can make the infection difficult to treat
*   Do not ever use any steroid containing OTC creams from chemists/ on own

TINEA PEDIS/ MANUUM
EXAMINATION
*   Dermatophytic infection of palms (**Tinea manuum**)and soles (**Tinea pedis**)
*   Generally unilateral involvement; toe webs commonly involved
*   Scaling may present along the creases of palms/soles only or may be diffuse; occasionally dried vesicles are seen
*   A scaly (+/- erythema) margin may be seen at the level of wrist (T. manuum) and at insteps or out steps of feet (T. pedis)
*   Coexistent involvement of nails is common

ONYCHOMYCOSIS
EXAMINATION
*   Discoloration of nail with build up of keratinous debris under the nail plate
*   Generally affects isolated nails asymmetrically
*   The whole nail may crumble in advanced cases
*   Look for simultaneous involvement of palms/soles
*   Ask for diabetes; signs of peripheral vascular disease

DIAGNOSIS
*   For doubtful cases: **KOH** microscopy of scales shows the typical septate hyphae
*   Culture and other advanced methods are not required in routine practice

GENERAL MEASURES
ADVISE THE FOLLOWING DOS AND DONTS TO THE PATIENT

| DOS                                      | DON'TS                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Take daily bath with regular bathing soap and normal temperature tap water | Do not share towels and clothes                             |
| Dry skin well after bath                 | Do not wash clothes separately in hot water and re-wear clothes |
| Wash clothes separately in hot water and dry inside out in the sun | before washing                                             |

TREATMENT
TOPICAL ANTIFUNGAL
For limited involvement in cases of **Tinea corporis** and **cruris**
USE
*   **Clotrimazole 1%/2% cream BD**
*   **Miconazole 2% cream BD**
*   **Terbinafine 1% cream BD**
*   **Ketoconazole 2% cream BD**
*   For extensive disease, it is not feasible to use antifungal creams alone; advise oral antifungals
OR
Advise anti fungal creams over most bothersome lesions only (in addition to systemic drugs)

TREATMENT IN CHILDREN
*   Always look for infection in the parents/caregivers
*   Prefer topical antifungals for younger children
*   Oral antifungals (weight based dosing)
    *   Terbinafine
        *   3-6mg/kg/day or
        *   <20kg : 62.5mg
        *   20-40kg : 125mg
        *   \>40kg : 250mg
    *   Fluconazole: 6mg/kg/day
    *   Griseofulvin: 10-20mg/kg/day

REFER TO A SPECIALIST/ TERTIARY CENTRE IF
*   Very extensive disease
*   No/minimal improvement with regular treatment after 4 weeks
*   Cure not achieved despite prolonged treatment and good compliance
*   Recurrent infection
*   Co-morbid conditions present:
    *   Pregnancy/lactation/hepatic disease/renal disease or cardiac disease
*   History of prolonged topical/oral/parenteral/ steroid use
*   Remember: The lesions are often modified by self application of topical steroids/combination products
    *   The "ring" may be incomplete
    *   Scaling may be minimal
    *   Pigmentation may be prominent
*   Do not use any steroid containing cream

GENERAL MEASURES
*   Prolonged treatment is required;
*   Treatment with adequate dosage for recommended duration should be adhered to
*   Advise patient to:
    *   Avoid walking barefoot in public places esp swimming pools/community bathing areas
    *   Wash feet with bathing soap and normal temperature tap water
    *   Wipe and dry well with a towel
    *   Dry toe clefts before wearing shoes/socks
    *   Wear cotton socks
    *   Wash worn socks separately in hot water

TREATMENT
SYSTEMIC TREATMENT
*   ALWAYS TREAT TILL ALL LESIONS HAVE COMPLETELY RESOLVED
*   This may take between 3-8 weeks or more depending on the extent of infection and previous treatments used; longer when palms/soles also involved or history of prolonged steroid use
*   Follow up regularly every 2 weekly
*   Oral antifungals for adults:
    *   Tab Terbinafine 250mg BD
    *   Tab Griseofulvin 500mg BD
    *   Tab Fluconazole 50-150 mg OD
*   For relief of pruritus:
    *   Tab Cetirizine 10mg HS or Tab CPM 4mg TDS

TREATMENT IN PREGNANCY
*   Preferably use only topical antifungals
*   Maximum safety data for use of
    *   Miconazole cream
    *   Clotrimazole cream
*   Limited safety data in humans to recommend use of any systemic antifungal during pregnancy esp first trimester
*   If required, fluconazole may be preferred

MANAGEMENT AT TERTIARY CARE
*   Individualise treatment
*   Treat till complete clinical and mycological cure (KOH negativity)
*   Send for culture, speciation and antifungal susceptibility testing, if available

TOPICAL TREATMENT (OVER LIMITED AREAS ONLY)
*   In addition to previously mentioned:
    *   Luliconazole cream topically OD
    *   Sertaconazole cream topically BD

SYSTEMIC TREATMENT
*   Cap Itraconazole 100-200 mg/day
*   Tab Terbinafine 250mg BD

GENERAL MEASURES
*   ADVISE PATIENTS TO:
    *   Keep affected nails trimmed as they are fragile and trauma prone
    *   Keep separate nail clippers
    *   Avoid any cosmetic nail procedures, pedicure/manicure
*   Inform the patient that it might take several months after treatment completion for a completely normal looking nail to appear and in severe cases, a cosmetically acceptable result may not be achieved

It is important to treat
the nail infection as it is a
potential focus for spread
of the fungus to other
body sites

TREATMENT
TOPICALS
*   Limited disease with less than 50% nail surface involvement/ not going back till the lunula
OR
*   Patients with contraindication for oral antifungals(eg. renal disease etc
    *   Amorolfine 5% nail lacquer application once a week or
    *   Ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer thrice a week

SYSTEMIC ANTIFUNGALS
*   Tab Terbinafine 250mg BD (6 weeks for fingernails and 12 weeks for toenails)
*   Cap Itraconazole 100 mg BD for 12 weeks
OR
200mg BD/day for seven days a month (2 such pulses for fingernails and 3 for toe nails)
