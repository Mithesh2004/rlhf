# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## LIVER FAILURE
ICD-10 K72.90

ACUTE LIVER FAILURE OR ACUTE ON CHRONIC LIVER FAILURE

### ACUTE LIVER FAILURE (ALF)
*   Acute liver injury
*   No underlying liver disease

### DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA
*   Jaundice < 4 weeks
*   **Encephalopathy**
*   **Coagulopathy** [INR ≥1.5]
*   No evidence of prior chronic liver disease such as splenomegaly, ascites etc

### CAUSES
*   Primary liver disease: Viral hepatitis, Drug induced hepatitis (e.g. ATT), Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy/HELLP syndrome, Poisoning
*   Systemic infection with secondary liver involvement: Malaria, Leptospirosis, Typhoid, Rickettsial disease
*   Suspect if:
    *   Fever is a predominant symptom
    *   Rash (Rickettsial)
    *   Renal dysfunction
    *   Anemia, thrombocytopenia, subconjunctival haemorrhage

### ACUTE ON CHRONIC LIVER FAILURE (ACLF)
*   Underlying liver disease
*   Acute precipitating event
*   Jaundice (Bilirubin ≥ 5mg/dL) and coagulopathy (INR ≥ 1.5)
*   Ascites/ Hepatic encephalopathy within 4 weeks of onset of jaundice; other organ failure
*   Evidence of chronic liver disease

### CAUSES
*   Acute precipitating event: Acute hepatitis, sepsis, GI bleeding, alcohol and drugs
*   Chronic liver disease: Alcohol/ hepatitis B or C/ non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/autoimmune liver disease/ Wilson's disease
*   Severity assessment of ACLF: Additional organ failure indicates severe disease

### INVESTIGATIONS
#### ESSENTIAL
*   Hemoglobin, Leucocyte count (Total and Differential), Platelet count, Prothrombin time-INR
*   Blood Sugar
*   Liver function test, Blood Urea, Serum Creatinine, Sodium/Potassium
*   Ascitic fluid analysis & culture
*   Ultrasound abdomen

#### DESIRABLE
*   Arterial blood gas and pH
*   Blood NH3 levels
*   UGIE in ACLF

### DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS
*   Primary liver diease- Serology: HBsAg, IgG Anti HBC, IgM anti-HAV, IgM anti HEV and anti HCV antibodies
*   Systemic Infection- Work up for Malaria/Typhoid/ Leptospira/Rickettsial infection in acute febrile illness

### MANAGEMENT
Urgent referral to a higher centre after initial stabilization of patient/ if no improvement/worsening despite therapy

#### PRIMARY TREATMENT/STABILIZATION:
*   I.V. Fluids: Normal saline/Ringer's lactate (Add 50% dextrose if blood sugar low)
*   O2 supplementation if required
*   Secure airway by tracheal intubation if grade 3-4 coma
*   Antibiotics/antimalarials depending on the clinical suspicion after taking blood culture
*   Inj. Pantoprazole 40mg IV once a day for stress ulcer prophylaxis
*   I.V. mannitol 20%, 100ml SOS for cerebral edema/grade 3-4 coma provided there is no renal failure in (ALF)
*   IV infusion N-Acetylcysteine 150mg/kg in drug (induced ALF) over 1 hour
    *   Loading :150 mg/kg over 1 hour, 50 mg/kg over 4 hours
    *   Maintainence: 100 mg/kg over 16 hours every day

#### MANAGEMENT AT HIGHER CENTRE
(In addition to primary treatment)
*   Admission in intensive care
*   Supportive treatment
    *   Prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotics after taking blood culture
    *   Correct hypo-/hyper-kalemia
    *   No role of prophylactic Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) for coagulopathy
*   If hepatitis B: Tenofovir or Entecavir
*   Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy/HELLP: prompt delivery
*   Re-investigate to diagnose acute and chronic liver injury
*   If GI Bleeding: Refer to STW on GI bleeding

### TREATMENT AT HIGHER CENTRE
|ORGAN FAILURE|SEPSIS|ENCEPHALOPATHY|
|---|---|---|
|1. Hypotension  *  Fluid resuscitation 20ml/kg over 2 hours  *  Maintenance fluid guided by hydration status and urine output  *  If no response >> Vasopressors: Noradrenaline I.V. infusion  2. Respiratory Failure  *  O₂ inhalation  *  Nebulization if bronchoconstriction  *  May require ventilation  3. Acute renal failure  *  Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance  *  Stop diuretics, No NSAIDs  *  In ACLF, Terlipressin: 1mg IV 6 hourly plus 20-40g albumin (20%) over 6-12 hours for volume expansion for suspected hepatorenal syndrome and not acute tubular necrosis  *  May require dialysis| Fluid resuscitation  *  I.V. antibiotics*:  *  For unidentified source: Broad spectrum antibiotics within an hour.  *  For SBP: IV Ceftriaxone 1g BD may be tried  *  To prevent hepatorenal syndrome: IV Albumin 20-40g over 6-12 hours  *(The choice of antibiotics may vary depending on local sensitivity pattern and availability)| *  Treat the underlying precipitating factor  *  Usual care for comatosed patient  *  Secure airway if grade 3-4 encephalopathy  FOR ACLF  *  Syrup Lactulose 20-30ml 6 hourly, titrate dose to produce 3-4 stools/day  *  Rifaximin 400mg TDS|

### ABBREVIATIONS
*   HELLP: Haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count
*   IgM anti-HBc: Immunoglobulin M antibody to Hepatitis B core antigen
*   IgM anti-HAV: Immunoglobulin M antibody to hepatitis a virus
*   IgM anti- HEV: Immunoglobulin M antibody to hepatitis E virus
*   HBsAg: Hepatitis B virus surface antigen
*   ATT: Anti-Tubercular treatment
*   INR: International normalised ratio
*   UGIE: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
