# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
NEONATAL EMERGENCY TRIAGE ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT

## SIGN OR AT-RISK NEONATE PRESENTING TO HEALTH FACILITY
*   Place under radiant warmer
*   Attach temperature probe and pulse oximeter
*   Assess for emergency signs using TABCD
*   Temperature
*   Airway and Breathing
*   Circulation (CFT, pulse, BP)
*   Coma/Convulsions
*   Dehydration

## EMERGENCY SIGNS
*   Apnea or gasping
*   Severe respiratory distress (severe retractions, grunt, RR>70)
*   Central cyanosis/oxygen satuation <91%
*   Shock (Cold peripheries, mottled/grey skin, CFT>3 sec, weak & fast pulse, low BP)
*   HR > 200/min
*   Coma or convulsions
*   Severe dehydration(in cases of diarrhoea)
*   Severe Hypothermia (< 32°C)

## PRIORITY SIGNS
*   Weight < 1800 g or > 3.8 kg
*   Respiratory distress (RR>60, no retractions)
*   Severe jaundice (onset < 24 h/palm or sole staining/ duration > 2 weeks)
*   Severe pallor
*   Bleeding
*   Major malformation (tracheo-esophageal fistula, meningomyelocele, gastroschisis, anorectal malformation)
*   Abdominal distension
*   Irritable/Restless
*   Refusal to feed
*   Moderate (32-35.9°C) or mild (36-36.4°C) hypothermia

## NON-URGENT SIGNS
*   Jaundice
*   Transitional stools
*   Minor birth trauma
*   Minor malformations
*   Superficial infections
*   Breastfeeding difficulty
*   Regurgitation

## INITIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT AND STABILIZE
*   Resuscitation as per NRP
*   Maintain TABC
*   Check SpO2 and start oxygen if < 91%
*   Start CPAP if respiratory distress
*   Start IV fluids as per weight and postnatal age (Refer to STW on Feeds & Fluids)
*   Check blood glucose, draw CBC and blood culture, and give first dose of antibiotics (Refer to STW on Sepsis in neonates)

## ASSESS AND ACT RAPIDLY
*   Maintain TABC
*   Check SpO2 and start oxygen if < 91%
*   Check blood glucose
*   Start IV fluids (if abdominal distension/GI malformation) or gavage feeds (Refer to STW on Feeds & Fluids)
*   Elicit perinatal risk factors for sepsis and evaluate if sepsis workup is needed (refer to STW on Sepsis in neonates)
*   Investigations as per clinical findings

## ASSESS AND COUNSEL
*   Assessment and treatment as per requirement
*   Explain danger signs
*   Counsel for breastfeeding

A neonate may have more than one condition

## SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT WORKFLOWS

### SHOCK
*   Provide warmth
*   IV NS 10mL/kg bolus over 30-60 min
*   May repeat bolus if evidence of volume deficit
*   Consider inotropes

### HR> 200/MIN
*   Urgent ECG-look for p waves
*   If SVT, consider ice-pack and IV adenosine
*   Check for and correct hyperthermia if present

### SEVERE DEHYDRATION
(Diarrhoea plus any two of lethargy, very slow skin pinch and sunken eyes)
*   Provide warmth
*   IV 30 mL/kg of RL or NS in 1 hour followed by 70 mL/kg in next 5 hours (WHO plan C)
*   If IV not possible, give ORS at 20 mL/kg/h for 6 hours
*   Assess 1-2 hourly and titrate the volume of fluids

### HYPOTHERMIA
(Refer to STW on thermal care of newborn)
*   Mild (36-36.4°C): Warm environment, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding
*   Moderate (32-35.9°C): Place under servo-controlled warmer; skin-to-skin contact till arranged
*   Severe (< 32°C): As for moderate hypothermia plus IV fluids and inj. vitamin K

### HYPOGLYCEMIA
(Refer to STW on neonatal hypoglycemia)
*   Blood glucose < 45mg/dL and asymptomatic: supervised breastfeeding or EBM
*   Blood glucose < 20 mg/dL OR symptomatic: 2mL/kg 10% dextrose IV followed by infusion @6mg/kg/min

### JAUNDICE
(Refer to STW on neonatal jaundice)
*   Serious jaundice (onset at < 24 h of age, palm or sole staining, or signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy): Intensive phototherapy, consider IV fluids if suspicion of dehydration, prepare for exchange blood transfusion

### SEIZURES
(Refer to STW on neonatal seizures)
*   Maintain TABC
*   Check blood glucose by glucometer: If < 45 mg/dL, 2mL/kg 10% dextrose IV followed by infusion @ 6mg/kg/min
*   If not controlled, 2 mL/kg 10% calcium gluconate IV, diluted 1:1 with D5, D10 or DW, over 10 min under cardiac monitoring
*   If not controlled, Inj. Phenobarbitone 20 mg/kg IV over 15 mins. If seizures persist after 15 min. consider another bolus of 10mg/kg phenobarbitone over 10 min

### SURGICAL
*   Cover any skin defects with warm saline sterile gauze
*   Maintain hydration
*   Consult surgeon

### BREASTFEEDING DIFFICULTY
*   Observe and look for proper positioning and attachment of baby during breastfeeding
*   Counsel mother
