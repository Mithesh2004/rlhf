# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## THERMAL CARE OF NEWBORN
ICD-10-P81.8

*Delivery room - in the first
hour after delivery

*Prior to and during transport

*At the time of admission

*Continuous monitoring for all
babies nursed in radiant
warmer/incubator

*At-risk neonates staying with
mother e.g. - LBW, preterms -
every 4 hourly

Temperature
measurement
for neonates is
mandatory in
the given
settings to
diagnose
hypothermia

STANDARD TECHNIQUE FOR MEASUREMENT OF
TEMPERATURE
* Use a standard digital thermometer
* Place the tip in the neonate's axilla
keeping it parallel to the neonate's trunk
* Read once the beep sound is heard

REGULARLY MONITOR TEMPERATURE AND DOCUMENT

```

### MILD HYPOTHERMIA: 36 °C-36.4 °C

* Ensure room temperature 25-28 °C
* Provide skin-to-skin (STS) contact
* Continue breastfeeding
* If sick, nurse under radiant warmer

* RECHECK TEMPERATURE IN 1 HOUR:
    * If normal, wrap properly
    * If still <36.5 °C then treat as moderate
    hypothermia

### MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA: 32°C-35.9 °C

* Nurse under radiant warmer in servo mode with
temperature probe attached to neonate
* Continue skin-to-skin contact till warmer is
available ensuring mother-neonate dyad is
covered with pre-warmed linen
* Start O₂ if SpO₂<91%
* Check blood sugar, if <45 mg/dL then follow STW
on Hypoglycemia
* Recheck temperature every 15 minutes till it
normalizes
* Continue feeding if stable and abdominal
examination is normal

### SEVERE HYPOTHERMIA: <32 °C

* Manage as per moderate
hypothermia
* Make nil per oral
* Start IV fluids (refer to STW on
Feeds and fluids)
* Give Inj. Vitamin K
* Refer to higher centre if develops
shock or respiratory failure (refer to
STW on Neonatal Transport)

## PREVENTION OF HYPOTHERMIA- MAINTENANCE OF WARM CHAIN

### DELIVERY ROOM (DR)
* Radiant warmer is must in Neonatal Care Corner
* Area should be air draught free
* All DRs should have room thermometer
* Maintain DR temperature >25 °C
* Switch on radiant warmer 20-30 minutes before delivery
* Radiant warmer should be in manual mode with heater
output being 100%
* Pre-warm two to three sterile towels by keeping them
under radiant warmer for 20 minutes
* Practice early skin-to-skin contact for stable neonates
for 1 hour or at least till first breastfeeding
* Dry newborn immediately after birth
* Remove wet linen immediately
* Weighing and checking temperature should be done
after breastfeeding

### POSTNATAL WARDS
* Cover neonate adequately
* Practice rooming-in 24x7
* Avoid air draughts by closing
windows, doors, and switching
off fans and air conditioners
* Start Kangaroo Mother Care
(KMC) as early as possible for
eligible neonate
* Promote exclusive breastfeeding
* Delay bath till after discharge
* Remove wet clothes as early as
possible
* Educate mother regarding
identification of hypothermia
using touch method

### WARM CHAIN DURING TRANSPORT

*Without external heat source:
    * A fully wrapped neonate with cap can
be transported in an adult's arms in a
closed vehicle
    * Neonate can be transported in
skin-to-skin contact
    * Ensure that the neonate is in upright
position and covered snuggly with the
person's clothes and a blanket
*With external heat source:
    * A thermal mattress or a transport
incubator
    * Indigenous insulated boxes can be
used in resource-limited settings
    * No neonate should be placed naked in
a trolley or bed without an external
heat source

Early skin-to-skin contact

Adequate clothing & rooming-in

Kangaroo Mother Care

Radiant warmer

HYPERTHERMIA
Neonates may become hyperthermic due to high environmental temperature and/or overclothing
Differentiate from sepsis: If both trunk & extremities are hot, an environmental cause is likely. If trunk is hot & extremities are cold, consider sepsis
If baby is hyperthermic, move to cooler environment and decrease clothing. Ensure adequate breastfeeding and check weight loss
If still hyperthermic, needs further evaluation
