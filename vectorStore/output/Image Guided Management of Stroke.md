# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## IMAGE GUIDED MANAGEMENT OF STROKE
ICD-10-163.9

*   Numbness or weakness especially on one side of the body
*   Loss of consciousness or altered consciousness
*   Decreased vision in one or both eyes
*   Language difficulties either in speaking or understanding
*   Confusion or loss of memory
*   Swallowing difficulties
*   Paralysis of any part of the body, including face
*   Sudden severe headache with no known cause
*   Difficulty in walking, loss of balance or coordination
*   Neck pain
*   Nausea and vomiting

## WHAT IS STROKE?

An episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal cerebral, spinal or retinal infarction or haemorrhage

## TYPES OF STROKE

*   **Ischemic stroke**: Focal cerebral, spinal or retinal infarction

*   **Intracerebral haemorrhage**: Focal collection of blood within the brain parenchyma or ventricular system that is not caused by trauma

*   **Subarachnoid haemorrhage**: Bleeding into the subarachnoid space structure

*   **Cerebral venous thrombosis**: Thrombosis of cerebral venous

*   **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)**: Transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal cerebral, spinal cord or retinal ischemia without acute infarction

### WARNING SIGN (BEFAST)

*   **BALANCE**: Loss of balance or coordination
*   **EYES**: Sudden blurred or double vision, sudden, persistent vision trouble
*   **FACE**: Deviation at the angle of the mouth
*   **ARM**: Arm drift
*   **SPEECH**: Slurred speech or the inability to speak or understand
*   **TIME**: Act fast
*   Sudden new onset of headache or loss of consciousness
*   Sudden giddiness, vomiting and imbalance

### WARNING SIGN (FAST)

*   **F**: stands for sudden numbness or weakness of **FACE**, especially on one side of the body
*   **A**: stands for sudden numbness or weakness of **ARM** or **LEG** especially on one side of the body
*   **S**: refers to difficulty in **SPEECH** and understanding
*   **T**: is the **TIME** to rush to the hospital

### INVESTIGATIONS

*   **Essential**
    *   CT scan head
    *   ECG
    *   Blood Sugar

*   **Desirable**
    *   CTA
    *   Echocardiogram
    *   Lipids
    *   Renal Parameter

*   **Optional**
    *   MRI/MRA
    *   Holter Monitoring

### PRELIMINARY MANAGEMENT

*   Assess and manage ABCs
*   Initiate cardiac monitoring
*   Maintain O2 saturation >94%
*   Establish IV access
*   Determine blood glucose and treat accordingly
*   Determine time of symptom onset or last known normal, and obtain family contact information, preferably a cell phone
*   Triage and RAPID TRANSFER of patient to nearest district hospital with CT Scan facility or Stroke center with facility for thrombolysis
*   Referral hospital to be notified to handle the referred patient with stroke

### IMAGING-WHAT ALL WE WANT TO KNOW?

*   Parenchyma-bleed vs. Ischemia, area involved
*   Pipes- Occlusion?, location: 1. Large vessel occlusion vs. Distal branch occlusion
*   Perfusion- collaterals? -Multiphase CT angiogram (3rd phase, predicts the outcome)
*   Penumbra- Tissue at risk (salvageable tissue)

Assess the 4Ps of stroke as quickly as possible

Time Vs. Information

### MANAGEMENT

*   Stroke onset time < 4.5 hrs
    *   IVtPA (0-4.5 Hrs) or endovascular treatment according to eligibility and availability (.9mg/kg/wt)
    *   10% as bolus, remaining 90% as I/V infusion over an hour
    *   BP maintained below 180/110 mm/Hg
    *   Dysphagia assessment, Blood pressure/blood sugar monitoring and IV fluids.
    *   Prevention of pneumonia
    *   Prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis etc, monitor and record ECG
*   Stroke onset time > 4.5 hrs
    *   Rapid Assessment, CODE Stroke, Blood pressure and Blood Sugar monitoring, NIHSS, Intravenous lines
    *   Endovascular treatment with Mechanical thrombectomy using stent retriever, aspiration, or hybrid techniques (4.5 hrs to 24hrs) according to eligibility

### STROKE PATIENT FLOW

*   NIHSS Score Calculation
*   NCCT + CTА

    *   No hemorrhage
        *   <4.5 Hours
            *   No LVO  -> IVT
            *   LVO -> IVT+
        *   4.5-24 Hours
            *   No LVO  -> + Clinico-radiological mismatch
            *   LVO -> MT*
    *   Hemorrhage
        *   CTA
            *   Aneurysm/AVM -> Surgery/Endovascular Treatment accordingly

*DAWN/DIFFUSE CRITERIA (BEYOND 6 HOURS)

*For advanced medical management refer to STW Stroke
