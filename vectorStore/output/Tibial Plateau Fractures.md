# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
TIBIAL PLATEAU FRACTURES

## Definition
A fracture involving the proximal end of the tibia which may or may not extend to the **articular surface** and/or **diaphyseal region**

## Mechanism of Injury
*   High-energy trauma in young patients (**RTA**)
*   Low-energy falls in elderly

## Radiographs
*   **AP View** - Schatzker classification
*   **Lateral View** - Posterior fracture component

**ICD-10-S82.109A**

Management of patient as per **ATLS** protocols
**Presentation**:
*   Pain, swelling, deformity at or below the knee

## Physical Exam
*   Look circumferentially to rule-out an open injury
*   Tenderness below the knee
*   Rule out **compartment syndrome** (blisters, ecchymosis, swelling, pain out of proportion)
*   Look for distal neurovascular deficit

## Investigations
**CT SCANS REQUIRED FOR**
*   Detailed assessment of fracture pathoanatomy & Preoperative planning
*   Column classification – **Luo**

### LOW ENERGY INJURY

Preferable to get a **CT scan**

### HIGH ENERGY INJURY

*   A. Airway and Cervical spine
*   B. Breathing and ventilation
*   C. Circulation and haemorrhage control
*   D. Disability and Neurological status
*   E. Exposure and Environment control

**Open Fractures - STW**

Urgent referral to higher centre for consideration for **Fasciotomy** and **external fixator** application

## Three Column Classification (LUO)
One column fracture is defined as an independent articular depression with a break in the column. Zero-column fracture = purely articular.

|             |                 |
| :---------- | :-------------- |
| Lateral Column | Medial Column   |
|             |                 |

| Anterolateral | Anteromedial |
| :------------ | :----------- |
| **C**        | **B**        |
| Posterior Column | |
| |
| Posterolateral | Posteromedial |
| **D**        | **A**        |

Plate application is based on the column concept. Attempt to reduce and fix each column individually

## Goals of Treatment
*   Restoration of joint stability
*   Anatomical reduction of the **articular surface**
*   Restoration of the mechanical axis of the lower limb

## Implant Options
### Anatomical locking plates
*   Buttressing against shear forces or Neutralizing rotational forces
*   Additionally - Rim plates/ fragment specific small plates/bone graft substitutes may be used on case to case basis
