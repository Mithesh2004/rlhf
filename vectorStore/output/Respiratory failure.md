# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of RESPIRATORY FAILURE
ICD 10: J96.0

## Symptoms

- Cough
- Shortness of breath
- Wheezing
- Chest tightness

## Signs

- Tachycardia
- Restlessness
- Anxiety
- Confusion
- Seizure
- Cyanosis
- Asterexis
- Arrhythmia

Look for underlying causes in hypercapnia, headache, bounding pulse, tremor/flap, papilloedema, coma.

HYPOXIA (SPO2 <90%)

| Condition | Symptoms | Signs |
|---|---|---|
| **HEART FAILURE** | • Dyspnea or exertion or rest• Wheezing• Fatigue | • Tachycardia• Chest Pain• Weak Rapid Thready Pulse• Pink Frothy Sputum• Cyanosis• Pallor• Distended Neck Veins |
| **PNEUMONIA/LRTI** | • Cough with or without Sputum• Chest Pain• Fever with Chills, Fatigue, Malaise | • Tachypnea• Tachycardia• Crackles and Rhonchi• Hypoxemia• Pleuritic Chest Pain |
| **PULMONARY EMBOLISM** | • Sudden Shortness of Breath• Chest Pain• Hemoptysis• Syncope | • Tachycardia• Calf Pain & or Swelling• Arrhythmia |
| **ACUTE ASTHMA** | • Wheeze• Shortness of Breath• Chest Tightness• Cough | • Tachypnea• Tachycardia• Fall in SPO2• Use of Accessory Muscle | N/A |
| **AIRWAY DISEASE AE of COPD** | • Worsening of Dyspnea• Increase in Sputum Production• Increased Cough | • Tachypnea• Hypoxemia• Hypercarbia• Confusion• Drowsy• Peripheral Edema | N/A |
| **BRONCHIOLITIS** | • Shortness of Breath• Cough• Wheezing | • Cyanosis• Nasal Flares• Tachypnea• Paradoxical Breathing (children)• Crackles and or Rattling sounds in Lung | N/A |

## Investigations

- ABG, CRP, FBC, U&E
- Chest Xray
- Sputum culture, Blood culture (if febrile)
- Spirometry(COPD, Neuromuscular disease)
