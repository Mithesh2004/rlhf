# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
DIABETIC RETINOPATHY (DR)
ICD-10-E11.31

## KEY POINTS

*   Diabetic retinopathy can be
asymptomatic in early as well
as advanced stages

*   Every newly diagnosed diabetic should be screened for
retinopathy at the point of detection of diabetes and thereafter
annually or more frequently as required by the retinopathy
grade

## PRELIMINARY SCREENING

### HISTORY
*   Duration of diabetes.
Compliance with treatment and
blood sugar monitoring
*   Any visual complaints
*   Any other systemic illness

### EXAMINATION
*   Vision, refraction, ophthalmic
examination including pupillary
reflexes, IOP, dilated fundus
examination with a direct/
indirect ophthalmoscope

## DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS

### ESSENTIAL
Slit lamp bio microscopy (retinal
exam), ultrasound-B scan
(when fundus not visible)

### DESIRABLE
Indirect ophthalmoscopy
Fundus photography

### OPTIONAL
OCT, FFA, OCTA if indicated
