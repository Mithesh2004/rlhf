# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
ACUTE SCROTUM IN CHILDREN

ICD-10-N50.8

Acute painful
swelling of the
scrotum or its
contents.

DEFINITION
Accompanied by
local signs and
general
symptoms

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE SCROTUM

| PATHOLOGY | FREQUENCY | AGE AT REPRESENTATION |
|-----------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| Extravaginal torsion of testis | Uncommon | Perinatal period |
| Intravaginal torsion of testis | Common | Anytime, peak at 13-16 yrs |
| Testicular appendage torsion | Very Common | Anytime, peak at 11 yrs |
| Epididymitis/Epididymo-orchitis | Rare | 0-6 months |
| Mumps orchitis | Uncommon | Only after puberty |
| Idiopathic scrotal edema | Uncommon | 0-5 yrs |
| Fat necrosis of scrotum | Rare | 5-15 yrs |
| Henoch Schonlein Purpura | Rare | 4-10 yrs |
| Testicular Trauma | Uncommon | Anytime, common in 5-15 yrs |

## DIFFERENTIATING CLINICAL FEATURES

### TORSION TESTIS
*   Sudden onset of pain in testis, lower abdomen or groin
*   Associated with nausea and vomiting
*   Local palpation - Very painful
*   Hemiscrotum - Red and edematous, bluish discoloration (Infarction of testis)
*   Transverse lie of testis
*   Absent cremastric reflex

### TORSION OF TESTICULAR APPENDAGE
*   Sudden onset pain but of less severe degree.
*   A bluish black spot (blue-dot) seen at the upper pole of the testis through the skin
*   Palpation of the testis less painful

### EPIDIDYMITIS/EPIDIDYMO-ORCHITIS
*   Inflammatory condition of the scrotum
*   Epididymis alone is usually affected before puberty (0-6 months)
*   Epididymo-orchitis is more common after puberty
*   History suggestive of -Urinary tract abnormalities or urethral instrumentation
*   Infecting organism - Usually Escherichia coli

### MUMPS ORCHITIS
*   Affects post-pubertal testis

### IDIOPATHIC SCROTAL EDEMA
*   Confused with torsion of testis or its appendages
*   Edema of scrotum with spread to or from inguinal region, penis, or perineum
*   Cause of edema - may be bacterial cellulitis or a topical allergy

### FAT NECROSIS
*   Sudden appearance of tender bilateral lumps in scrotal skin
*   Affected boys are often obese
*   History of swimming in cold water

### HENOCH SCHONLEIN PURPURA
*   Present with signs of acute scrotal swelling
*   Before or after other systemic signs and symptoms
*   Most commonly bilateral and rarely painful

## INVESTIGATIONS

### TESTICULAR TORSION IS MOST IMPORTANT CONDITION TO RULE OUT
*   Unequivocal cases
*   No investigations- Immediate scrotal exploration
*   Equivocal cases
    *   Doppler study of scrotum
    *   Radionuclide testicular scan

### TORSION OF TESTICULAR APPENDAGE
*   Mandatory- USG scrotum and Doppler scrotum
*   Desirable-Urine analysis

### EPIDIDYMO-ORCHITIS
*   Mandatory- Urine analysis
*   Desirable Ultrasonography of scrotum

### TESTICULAR TRAUMA
*   Mandatory: USG scrotum

## TREATMENT

### TESTICULAR TORSION
*   Immediate scrotal exploration in golden window of 4-8 hours if investigative facilities not available
*   Clinical exploration if bell clapper deformity seen
*   Contralateral orchiopexy if bell clapper anomaly on affected side
*   Orchidectomy preferable in older children if other testis is normal
*   Refer if no surgical facility available
*   Testicular prosthesis at a later date

### TORSION OF TESTICULAR APPENDAGE
*   Restricted activity
*   Warm compression
*   Anti inflammatory drugs
*   If not differentiable from torsion testis- Exploration and excision of necrotic appendage

### IDIOPATHIC SCROTAL EDEMA
*   Anti-histaminics
*   Topical corticosteroids

### HENOCH-SCHONLEIN PURPURA
*   Supportive treatment
*   Rarely systemic corticosteroids

### TESTICULAR INJURY
*   Mostly supportive
*   Surgery if large hematoma/ tunica albuginea rupture on USG
