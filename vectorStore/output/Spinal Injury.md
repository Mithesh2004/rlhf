# Standard Treatment Workflow
**SPINAL INJURY**
ICD-S14.109A 

## DEFINITION
* Injury to any of the following
    * Vertebral Column and it’s adnexae (disc, ligaments, facets etc)
    * **Spinal cord** (Partial/ Complete)
    * **Cauda Equina** and nerve roots
* Acute <3 weeks
* Subacute 3 weeks - 3 months
* Chronic >3 months

## WHEN TO SUSPECT
* Always rule out spine injury in patients with **poly-trauma**, especially if unconscious
* Ascertain pain in the neck, back or limbs
* Rapid sensorimotor examination- ability to move fingers, hands, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, toes
* **Priapism** (in unconscious/unresponsive)

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION
### SYMPTOMS:
* Pain (neck or back)
* Inability to move the limbs
* Numbness
* Breathing difficulty
* Inability to void and defecate

### SIGNS:
#### Local
* Deformity (swelling, gibbus)
* Bruising
* Open wound over spine
* Tenderness over spine

#### Systemic
* **Bradycardia** with **hypotension**
* Sensorimotor deficit in arms, legs
* Labored breathing 
* **Priapism**

## PRIMARY CARE
### GOALS
* Identify/suspect
* Immobilise
* Refer to higher center

### MANAGEMENT
* **ATLS** protocol (Airway-breathing-circulation-disability-exposure)
* Intubate/ventilate with **C spine** control
* **IV Line** Ringer Lactate; collect blood for grouping and cross matching; catheterise
* Log roll and inspect neck and back for bruise, deformity, tenderness
* Immobilise with ambulance man’s collar/ philadelphia collar/spine board/sand bags
* Manage pain with morphine/pethidine or unless contraindicated
* Transfer to higher centre

## SECONDARY CARE
### GOALS
 Where General/Orthopaedic surgeon or Neuro surgeon {trained in spine} available
* Imaging: **X ray/ CT SCAN**
* Determine neurological status
* Develop treatment plan

### MANAGEMENT
* Secondary survey as per **ATLS** protocol
* Conscious/ unconscious 
* Log roll and examine cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral spine
* Detailed neurological examination (Frankel scale) and document (Appendix I)
* Associated injuries
* Imaging (appropriate X rays, **CT** whole spine scans/MRI if available)
* **TLICS/SLIC** scoring (Appendix II/ III) – 
    * surgery: indicated/doubtful – refer;
    * conservative: brace
* **MPSS** in selected cases (Appendix IV)
* Apply collar/skull traction/halo vest, brace or spine board to transfer

## TERTIARY CARE
### GOALS
* Imaging: x-ray/CT SCAN/MRI 
* Surgery/ Conservative management
* Rehabilitation

### MANAGEMENT
* Detailed neurological evaluation (**ASIA** scale)
* Imaging (**X Ray, CT, MRI**) 
* Classify spinal injury and score
* **TLICS/SLIC** <4 conservative management; >5 surgery; 4-case based
* **MPSS** as indicated
* **DVT** prophylaxis as indicated (Appendix V)
* Surgery as indicated (decompression/ stabilisation)
* Conservative care-skull traction, halo vest, **SOMI** brace, **TLSO** brace
* Rehabilitation 

## APPENDIX 1: FRANKEL SCALE
* Grade A: Complete neurological injury - No motor or sensory function detected below level of lesion
* Grade B: Preserved sensation only - No motor function detected below level of lesion, some sensory function below level of lesion preserved 
* Grade C: Preserved motor, nonfunctional - Some voluntary motor function preserved below level of lesion but too weak to serve any useful purpose
* Grade D: Preserved motor, Functionally useful voluntary motor function below level of injury
* Grade E: Normal motor function - Normal motor and sensory function below level of lesion, abnormal reflexes may persist

## APPENDIX II: TLICS SCORE

| Intact | 0 |
| Nerve root involvement | 1 |
| Complete cord injury | 2 |
| Incomplete cord injury | 3 |
| Persistent cord compression | +1 |
|  |  |
| Non operative | <4 |
| Equivocal | 4 |
| Operative | >4 |

## APPENDIX III: SLIC SCORE
| Characteristics | Points |
| --- | --- |
| Injury Morphology | |
| No abnormality | 0 |
| Compression fracture | 1 |
| Burst fracture | 2 |
| Distraction | 3 |
| Translation/rotation | 4 |
| Integrity of the disco-ligamentous complex | |
| Intact | 0 |
| Indeterminate | 1 |
| Disrupted | 2 |
| Neurological Status | |
| Intact | 0 |
| Nerve root injury | 1 |
| Complete cord injury | 2 |
| Incomplete cord injury | 3 |

## APPENDIX IV: MPSS GUIDELINES (MODERATE EVIDENCE AND WEAK RECOMMENDATION)
* Methyl Prednisolone Sodium Succinate: 30mg/kg bolus and 5.4mg/Kg/hr x 23 hours
* Role of **MPSS**: 
 * May consider but be aware of the complications of high dose of steroids
 * Acute spinal cord injury less than 8 hours, incomplete neurology: consider
 * Acute spinal cord injury more than 8 hours, incomplete/complete cord injury neurology : no role
 * Acute spinal cord injury less than 8 hours, complete neurology: no role
 * Acute spinal cord injury with thoracic/abdominal visceral injury: contraindicated

## APPENDIX V: DVT PROPHYLAXIS
* All neurologically compromised (non-ambulatory) patients within 72 hours must receive **DVT** prophylaxis.
* Subcutaneous **LMW Heparin**/ fixed low dose unfractionated heparin
* No adjusted dose unfractionated heparin
* Duration 8-12 weeks depending on risk factors

## ANCILLARY PROCEDURES
* Goal **MAP** ≥ 85 mmHg for blunt/incomplete penetrating injury
* Consider early tracheostomy (< 7 days) in high cervical injury (C1-C5) patients
* Goal **MAP** ≥ 65 mmHg for complete penetrating injury
* Nor-epinephrine **IV** infusion (0.1- 0.5 mcg/kg/min)
* Early neurosurgical decompression of acute spinal cord compression (< 72 hours) is recommended
