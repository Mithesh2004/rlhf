# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## SUPRACONDYLAR FRACTURE OF HUMERUS IN CHILDREN
ICD-10-S42.413A

Pain, swelling and
loss of movement at
elbow

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

Most
commonly in
children aged
5-7 years

Fall on
outstretched
arm

Fracture is just above
the epicondyles of
humerus (upper limb)

### GARTLAND CLASSIFICATION OF
SUPRACONDYLAR FRACTURES

TYPE I:
Undisplaced
fracture

TYPE II:
Displaced fracture with
variable angulation,
posterior cortical continuity
of humerus preserved

TYPE III:
Completely displaced
fractures with cortical
discontinuity. Soft
tissue gap variable

AP X-ray of type III
supracondylar fractures

Lateral X-ray of type III
supracondylar fractures

## EXAMINATION

*   Swelling
*   Deformity
*   Ecchymosis
*   Limited active and passive
    elbow motion

### DISTAL NEUROVASCULAR EXAMINATION (ALWAYS COMPARE WITH NORMAL LIMB)

VASCULAR EXAMINATION | WELL PERFUSED | POORLY PERFUSED
-------------------------|----------------|-----------------
*   Assess radial pulse  | Warm and pink  | Cold and pale
Assess vascular |                |                 
perfusion          |                |                 

*   If vascular injury is suspected it should be treated as an emergency

### NEUROLOGICAL
EXAMINATION
*   Median nerve
*   Radial nerve
*   Ulnar nerve
Detailed examination of
these nerves should be
carried out if suspected

### INVESTIGATIONS
ESSENTIAL | DESIRABLE
----------|----------
Radiographs: AP and lateral x-ray elbow. The comparative x-ray of | Immediate arterial doppler/ CT angiography (in case of
contralateral elbow should be done, if suspicion is strong and x-ray of | suspected vascular injury)
injured elbow appears normal |          

## TREATMENT
### MANAGEMENT OF
OPEN FRACTURES

PRIMARY CARE
1.  Inj **Tetanus toxoid**
2.  Pain management
3.  Liberal saline wash
4.  Removal of visible dirt
    and debris
5.  Sterile dressing and
    splintage
6.  First dose antibiotic after
    test dose (Broad
    spectrum antibiotics)
7.  Refer to higher center

SECONDARY/ TERTIARY CARE
All of above plus
Reassess patient

### MANAGEMENT OF CLOSED FRACTURES (IF X-RAY NOT AVAILBALE FOLLOW THE
SIMILAR MANAGEMENT IN SITUATIONS OF SUSPICION)

PRIMARY CARE
1.  Pain management
2.  Splintage using triangular sling/ lateral elbow sling/ well padded moulded cramer wire splint in the
    position of deformity
3.  If vascular injury is suspected it should be treated as an emergency
4.  Refer to higher centre

TYPE I: | SECONDARY/ TERTIARY CARE (X-RAY AVAILABLE)
-------|-------------------------------------------
Immobilise: | TYPE II: One attempt of closed
Above elbow | reduction under anaesthesia with
well padded | radiological control
cast with 90  |a) Closed reduction possible: above
degree elbow | elbow plaster cast in flexion of elbow
flexion for   | (10 degrees short of radial pulse) and
three weeks  | pronation of forearm. Observe the
Follow-up: | patient for distal neuro-vascular
X-ray at 1 week | deficits and swelling for at least 24
to assess for | hours. Follow-up Xray should be done
displacement| at 5 days for any displacement
           | b) Closed reduction failed/
           | impossible: Open reduction and
           | pinning

| TYPE III: supracondylar fractures/flexion type/
| medial column collapse
| a) Neurovascular deficit absent: Closed
| reduction and percutanous pinning (CRPP)
| b) Neurovascular deficit present: Open
| Reduction and pinning;
| C) Nerve injury without Vascular Injury: reduce
| fracture and observe for recovery of nerve injury
| for 3 weeks
| in case of suspected/proved distal neurovascular
| injury refer to tertiary centre. Emergent closed
| reduction of displaced pediatric supracondylar
| fractures must be performed in patients with
| decreased perfusion of the hand

These are signs of **Compartment**
syndrome (**Volkmann's ischaemia**)
and may require urgent fasciotomy,
along with management of vascular
injury and fracture fixation

#### RED FLAG SIGNS FOR REFERRAL
*   Paresthesia
*   Pulselessness
*   Pain on passive stretching
*   Pallor
*   Paralysis

## KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES

This STW has been prepared by national experts of India with feasibility considerations for various levels of healthcare system in the country. These broad guidelines are advisory, and
are based on expert opinions and available scientific evidence. There may be variations in the management of an individual patient based on his/her specific condition, as decided by
the treating physician. There will be no indemnity for direct or indirect consequences. Kindly visit the website of DHR for more information: (stw.icmr.org.in) for more information.
