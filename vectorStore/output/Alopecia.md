### GENERAL HAIR CARE PRINCIPLES
*   Hair fall of upto 100 per day may
be normal and need not cause
alarm
*   Regular cleaning of scalp and
hair with plain shampoo
*   Avoid hair oil application and
damaging mechanical/
chemical hair care procedures

**NON SCARRING ALOPECIA (SMOOTH BALD AREAS WITH SMALL BLACK INTACT HAIR FOLLICLES)**

CONGENITAL
*   Alopecia due to inherited/
congenital disorders with
or without easy hair
breakage
    *   Congenital
    hypotrichosis
    *   Monilethrix
