# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for FEMALE INFERTILITY
ICD-10-N97

## WHAT IS INFERTILITY?
*   Infertility is a **disease** of the male or female reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse in women < 35 years of age or within 6 months in women > 35 years of age
*   Affects up to 15% of couples

## WHEN TO SUSPECT INFERTILITY?
*   Any couple who by definition has **infertility**
*   Those with high risk of **infertility**
    *   Women > 35 years: Expedited evaluation
    *   Women >40 years: Immediate evaluation
    *   **Oligomenorrhea** or **amenorrhea**
    *   Known or suspected uterine, tubal, or peritoneal disease
    *   History of tubal/ovarian surgery
    *   History of **chemotherapy/radiotherapy**
    *   Any female with **endometriosis**
    *   Known or suspected **male infertility**

## HISTORY OF THE COUPLE
*   Duration of **Infertility** / Contraceptive use
*   Fertility in previous/current relationships
*   Previous fertility investigations/ treatment

### DRUG HISTORY
*   Agents causing increased **Prolactin** / **Chemotherapy** / **Radiotherapy** / **anabolic steroids** / **anti-androgens**

### SURGICAL HISTORY
*   Previous abdominal/pelvic/ gynecological surgeries

### OCCUPATIONAL HISTORY
*   Work patterns including separation from partner
*   Exposure to chemicals or high temperature

### SEXUAL HISTORY
*   Coital frequency, timing, knowledge of fertile period
*   **Dyspareunia**
*   Postcoital bleeding

## MEDICAL HISTORY
## MENSTRUAL HISTORY
*   **Menarche**
*   Cycle length & duration of flow
*   **Dysmenorrhea**
*   Amenorrhea episodes
*   HMB/IMB

## OBSTETRIC HISTORY
*   Number of previous pregnancies (MTP/miscarriage/ectopic preg)
*   Time to initiate previous pregnancies

## PAST HISTORY
*   Chronic illness like chronic hypertension, **diabetes mellitus**, arthritis, tuberculosis

### PERSONAL HISTORY
*   History of smoking, alcohol intake, substance abuse
*   Vigorous exercise/eating disorder

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF FEMALE

### General
*   Height
*   Weight
*   BMI
*   Waist circumference
*   Blood pressure
*   Fat & Hair distribution
*   Acne
*   **Acanthosis nigricans**
*   Thyroid examination
*   Breast examination

### Abdominal
*   Abdominal mass & tenderness
*   Type and site of scars

### Pelvis
*   Assess state of hymen, clitoris and labia
*   Look for vaginal infection, septum, endometriotic deposits
*   Check for cervical polyps
*   Accessibility of cervix for insemination
*   Uterine size, position, mobility and tenderness
*   Adnexal fornices tenderness
*   Cervical smear

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF MALE
Refer to STW for the management of **male infertility** (ICD-10-N46.9), STW Volume 1, 2019

## EVALUATION OF FEMALE

### ESSENTIAL INVESTIGATIONS
Baseline ultrasound (Transvaginal ultrasound) to assess
*   Uterus: Look for endometrial thickness, pattern, any space occupying lesions like fibroid, adenomyosis, polyp or mullerian anomalies
*   Adnexa: Look for any **hydrosalpinx** or para-ovarian cyst
*   Ovary: Note the **antral follicle count** (Day 2-5 of menstrual cycle), volume, position, characterization of cyst if present
*   POD: Note presence of free fluid

*   Test for tubal patency
    *   Hysterosalpingography (HSG)

### OPTIONAL INVESTIGATIONS
*   Endometrial aspiration for AFB/PCR: to rule out tuberculosis
*   Serum AMH
*   Viral markers: HIV, HBsAg, HCV
*   VDRL
*   Rubella IgM/IgG
*   Day 2/3 FSH, LH,
*   Serum TSH, Prolactin

## MANAGEMENT
### DEPENDING UPON THE FACTOR OF INFERTILITY

Caution:
Always keep in mind age of the female as it is the most important prognostic factor
