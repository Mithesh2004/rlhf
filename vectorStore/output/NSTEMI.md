CONSIDER ANGINA IF
*   Diffuse retrosternal pain, heaviness or constriction. Radiation to arms or neck or back
*   Associated with sweating
*   Easily reproduced with post-meal exertion
*   Consider atypical presentation: Exertional fatigue or breathlessness or profuse sweating or epigastric discomfort
*   More likelihood if known patient of CAD/multiple risk factors

RED FLAG SIGNS
*   Pain lasting for more than 20 minutes
*   Recurrent or ongoing pain or rest pain
*   Associated breathlessness, profuse sweating or syncope
*   Hemodynamic instability
*   Refer as emergency to nearest Primary PCI/Thrombolysis capable centre
*   Rest pain beyond 24hrs or without above features may be referred early for further evaluation

ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME:
1.  Angina at rest or lasting more than 20 minutes
2.  Recent worsening of stable angina (crescendo) to CCS class III
3.  New onset effort angina of less than 1 month in CCS class II/III
4.  Post infarction angina

ECG:
*   If ST Elevation: Follow ST Elevation MI (STEMI) STW
*   If no ST Elavation: UA/NSTEMI

LOOK FOR OTHER CAUSES OF PROLONGED CHEST PAIN

| Variable location or characteristic | Dissection of aorta (unequal/ absent peripheral pulses) | Respiratory Evaluation: Pleuritis/ pneumonitis/ embolism/pneumothorax | Pericardial rub | Neuralgia or herpes |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ | :---------------- |

ANGINA UNLIKELY IF:
*   Long lasting (hours to days) or short lasting (less than a minute)
*   Restricted to areas above jaw or below epigatrium
*   Localized to a point
*   Pricking or piercing or stabbing type of pain
*   Precipitated by movement of neck or arms or respiration

2.  TIMI SCORE:
    One point for each of following
    1.  Age >65 yrs
    2.  More than 3 risk factors
    3.  Known CAD (>50% lesion)
    4.  Recurrence of angina in 24 hrs
    5.  Aspirin use within 7 days
    6.  ST deviation >0.5 mV

Sum total = TIMI score of patient

UNSTABLE ANGINA OR NSTEMI DIAGNOSIS

Other risk factors Points
Cardiac arrest at admission 39
ST-Segment Deviation 28
Elevated Cardiac Enzyme Levels 14

Sum Total= GRACE score of patient

| Very high risk Clinical instability GRACE > 140, TIMI ≥4 | High risk GRACE 109-140, TIMI2-3 | Intermediate risk Clinical instability. rise in cTn, or ECG changes | Low risk GRACE <109, TIMI ≤1 |

UA/NSTEMI: RISK CATEGORIZATION:
Based on clinical features, GRACE score & TIMI score
A). Very high risk:
*   Acute LVF
*   Hypotension
*   Uncontrolled Ventricular arrhythmia
*   Severe MR
B. High Risk:
*   GRACE score > 140 or TIMI score >4
C. Intermediate Risk:
*   GRACE score 109-140 or TIMI score 2-3
D. Low Risk:
*   Grace score <108 or TIMI score 0-1

Invasive evaluation

Non-invasive ischaemic testing

UA/NSTEMI: RISK CATEGORY MANAGEMENT:
A)Low risk:
1.  Conservative management: Aspirin, clopidogrel, BB and statin
2.  TMT if ambulatory patient within a week to risk stratify
3.  Refer low risk for re-vascularization if
    *   Recurrent pain
    *   Hemodynamic deterioration
    *   New ECG change
B. Intermediate/ Very High/ High risk: Re-vascularization
