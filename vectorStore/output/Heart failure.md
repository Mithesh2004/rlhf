# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of HEART FAILURE: A BREATHLESS PATIENT

ICD-10-150.9

## SYMPTOMS

*   1.  **Dyspnea/ orthopnea/ PND**
*   2.  Pink frothy sputum
*   3.  Dependent pedal edema
*   4.  Recent weight gain
*   5.  Easy fatiguability
*   6.  H/0 CHF/ MI

## SIGNS

*   1.  Tachypnoea
*   2.  Tachycardia or irregular pulse
*   3.  Basal crepitations
*   4.  Cardiomegaly
*   5.  Presence of murmurs
*   6.  Systemic desaturation

## MANAGEMENT AT PHC

*   Rule out respiratory cause: Breathlessness with fever, cough and expectoration or known patient of asthma or COPD
*   Likely CHF: Decongest with **furosemide**
*   REFER IF FOLLOWING:
    *   BP < 90 mmHg or > 200 mmHg
    *   Heart rate < 50/min or > 120/min
    *   Respiratory rate > 30/min or cyanosis
    *   Oliguria
    *   Altered sensorium

## MANAGEMENT AT DISTRICT HOSPITAL

*   Admit and re-assess
*   Optimise therapy with **furosemide/ enalapril/ spironolactone/ O2** and stabilize
*   Consider non-invasive ventilation if marked respiratory distress and O2 saturation < 90%
*   Echocardiography: confirm diagnosis of HFrEF: LV ejection fraction < 35%
*   Search for etiological diagnosis
*   Consider **carvedilol** after decongestion
*   Refer back to CHC/PHC after stabilization

## REFER TO TERTIARY CARE IF

*   CHF uncontrolled,
*   Unstable hemodynamics
*   Suspected ongoing ischemia
*   Abnormal electrolytes
*   Abnormal renal functions
*   Structural heart disease
*   Unclear etiology

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

*   Prior history of respiratory illness like asthma or COPD
*   Known patient of CHF/ similar illness in past with response to therapy
*   Prior history of RHD, CAD, pregnancy, cancer chemotherapy
*   Risk factors: HT, DM, smoking, hyperlipidemia or premature CAD in first degree relatives

## COMMON ETIOLOGY AND INDICATORS

*   1.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy: past MI
*   2.  Diabetic cardiomyopathy
*   3.  RHD: existing valvular disease
*   4.  Post-viral: acute onset breathlessness within last 3 months
*   5.  Peri-partum cardiomyopathy-onset in last trimester or after delivery
*   6.  Idiopathic cardiomyopathy
*   7.  Post-cancer chemotherapy

## MANAGEMENT AT CHC

*   Admit and stabilize
*   Send for routine investigations
*   ECG: Rule out acute ST-Elevation MI
*   X-ray chest: Rule out respiratory etiology
*   Decongest with intravenous **furosemide**
*   O2 therapy if systemic saturation < 90%
*   Start **enalapril** and **spironolactone** orally
*   Consider **carvedilol** after decongestion

## REFER TO A DISTRICT HOSPITAL

## MANAGEMENT AT TERTIARY HOSPITAL

1.  Re-assess and confirm diagnosis of HF
2.  Categorize acute (< 3 months) vs chronic (> 3 months) and HFrEF (EF 35%) vs HFpEF (EF 35-50%)
3.  Optimize therapy with **furosemide**, **enalapril**, **carvedilol**, **spironolactone** and **O2**
4.  Consider ARNI and ivabradine
5.  Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines
6.  Investigate for etiology and manage
7.  Consider non-pharmacological invasive therapy
    *   a. **ICD**: In selected patients (Ref Arrhythmia STW)
    *   b. **BiV**: Consider in NYHA class II/III Symptomatic patient, EF <35%, QRS >150msec in sinus rhythm with LBBB morphology and optimal medical therapy of >3 months
8.  Etiology based Interventions
    *   a. **PCI**
    *   b. Valve replacement
    *   c. **CABG**

## CONSIDER AT ALL LEVELS

*   Smoking Cessation
*   Salt restriction
*   Physical activity
*   Weight Reduction
*   Moderation of alcohol
*   Control of DM/ HTN/ Lipids
*   Secondary CVD prevention with aspirin and statins

## INVESTIGATIONS:

### BASIC INVESTIGATIONS

*   Hemogram, ESR
*   Blood sugar
*   Urine examination
*   Urea/ Creatinine
*   Sodium/Potassium
*   ECG
*   Chest X-ray PA view

### WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN X RAY

*   Cardiomegaly
*   Pulmonary venous congestion
*   Pneumonia or other lung pathology

### WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN AN ECG?

*   Pathological Q wave
*   Conduction abnormalities, especially LBBB
*   Chamber enlargement
*   Atrial fibrillation
*   Note: If ST elevation present, manage as STEMI

### DESIRABLE INVESTIGATIONS

*   2D Echocardiography
*   BNP/NT pro-BNP
*   Troponin
*   Lipid profile
*   Thyroid function test
*   Iron profile

### OPTIONAL INVESTIGATION

*   Prolonged ECG monitoring
*   Coronary angiography
*   Radionuclide imaging
*   CT scan
*   MRI
*   PET
*   Myocardial biopsy
*   Electrophysiological study

## COMMON DRUGS AND DOSAGE FOR CHF

### FUROSEMIDE

*   Dose 20-80 mg daily PO
*   Intravenous 10-40 mg SOS in acute stage
*   Change to oral when symptoms subside
*   Monitor serum electrolytes, creatinine and uric acid on therapy

### SPIRONOLACTONE

*   Dose 25-50 mg once daily PO
*   Keep watch on serum potassium and creatinine every 2-4 weekly

### CARVEDILOL

*   Dose 3.125 to 25 mg twice daily PO
*   Start after decongestion with low dose with BP > 100 mmHg and HR >60/ min
*   Uptitrate dose 1-2 weekly till maximum tolerable dose
*   Keep watch on BP, heart rate and precipitation of CHF symptoms
*   Increase diuretics and reduce carvedilol to manage reappearance of CHF

### ENALAPRIL

*   Dose 2.5 to 10 mg twice daily PO
*   Start with low dose with BP >100 mmHg, normal electrolyte and creatinine less than 2.5 mg/dl
*   Uptitrate dose 1-2 weekly till maximum tolerable dose
*   Keep watch on BP and electrolytes before every increment and on follow-up

## KEEP WATCHING

*   1.  Respiratory distress and oxygen saturation
*   2.  BP and heart rate
*   3.  Electrolytes and renal parameters

## KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES
