**OSTEOARTHRITIS OF KNEE JOINT**
ICD-10-M19.9

## Symptoms
*   Pain that increases with activity & relieves with rest
*   Joint stiffness especially in the morning or after a period of rest for short duration
*   Decrease in **Range of Motion (ROM)** of the knee, making it difficult to stand from sitting position, get in and out of chair or car, stair climbing, or walk
*   Creaking, crackling sounds on movement of knee
*   Swelling and feeling of warmth in the joint may be present

## Signs
*   Joint line tenderness
*   Patello-femoral crepitus
*   Decreased ROM
*   Deformity (commonly flexion and varus)
*   Joint effusion and synovial thickening may be present

## Investigation
*   X-rays
*   Bilateral Knee - AP (standing) and lateral views

## Management

### Kellgren and Lawrence (Radiological) Classification Osteoarthritis of Knee
**Classification**
*   Grade 0: No radiographic features of OA are present
*   Grade 1: Doubtful **Joint Space Narrowing (JSN)** and possible osteophytic lipping
*   Grade 2: Definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph
*   Grade 3: Multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity
*   Grade 4: Large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity

*   High tibial osteotomy may be considered in younger patients with significant varus deformity

### Indications of surgery for total knee replacement
Patients with osteoarthritis Kellgren and Lawrence grade 4 with following features may require surgery after appropriate conservative treatment has failed
*   Severe knee pain or stiffness that limits activities of daily living including walking, climbing stairs, and getting in and out of chairs
*   Patient unable to walk short distances (due to significant knee pain) and requires use of a cane/walker
*   Regular analgesic requirement over a long period
*   Moderate or severe knee pain while on rest either day or night
*   Severe deformity

### Conservative Treatment
*   Topical **NSAIDs**
*   Oral **Acetaminophen**
*   Oral **NSAIDs** (If not contraindicated) as and when required

*   Quadriceps strengthening and Hamstring stretching exercises
*   Lifestyle modifications such as avoid cross legged sitting and squatting and stair climbing wherever possible
*   Weight loss

### Contraindications for Knee Replacement
*   Recent or current knee sepsis
*   Remote source of ongoing infection
*   Extensor mechanism discontinuity or severe dysfunction
*   Recurvatum deformity secondary to neuromuscular weakness
*   Presence of a painless, well-functioning knee arthrodesis

| Grade 0    | Grade 1       | Grade 2   | Grade 3     | Grade 4     |
| :----------- | :------------ | :-------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| No OA        | Doubtful OA   | Mild OA   | Moderate OA | Severe OA   |
| No Osteophites| Possible Osteophites | Definite Osteophites | Moderate Osteophites | Large osteophites |
| No JSN       | Doubtful JSN  | Possible JSN | Definite JSN  | Great JSN   |

### Abbreviations
*   AP: Antero-posterior
*   OA: Osteoarthritis
*   NSAIDs: Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs
