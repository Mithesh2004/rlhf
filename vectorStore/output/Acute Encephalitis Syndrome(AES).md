# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**ACUTE ENCEPHALITIS SYNDROME (AES) IN CHILDREN**
ICD-10-G04

## SYMPTOMS
*   Acute onset of fever (</= 5-7 days) with
    altered sensorium and/or new onset of
    seizures
    (excluding simple
    febrile seizures)

*   Fever, headache, vomiting,
    lethargy, unconsciousness

*   Seizures

*   Abnormal posturing

*   Paucity of limb movements

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (HISTORY OF)
*   Rash, vesicles, past history of chicken pox
*   Residence of child: rural/urban, endemic for cerebral malaria, any
    epidemic of AES in neighborhood
*   Animal contact, insect bite, dog bite
*   Drug or toxin exposure- enquire for presence of any drugs at home
*   Recent travel
*   Trauma
*   Seizures
*   Recent immunizations
*   Recurrent episodes of encephalopathy
*   Past or concurrent systemic illness
*   Pre-morbid developmental/ neurological status of the child

## EXAMINATION

### VITAL SIGNS
*   Temperature
*   Pulse rate
*   Respiratory rate
*   Blood pressure

### GENERAL EXAMINATION
*   Pallor
*   Petechieae
*   Rash
*   Icterus

### NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION
*   Level of consciousness by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
*   Abnormal posturing- decerebrate, decorticate
*   Active seizures
*   Cranial nerves: pupil size and reaction, doll's eye movements, squint, facial deviation
*   Focal neurological deficits
*   Meningeal signs

## INVESTIGATIONS

### ESSENTIAL
CBC, LFT, KFT, blood sugar, CECT Brain,
CSF examination* (cytology, biochemistry,
culture, AFB staining, Gene Xpert), peripheral
smear for malarial parasite, Rapid Malarial
Antigen Test

### DESIRABLE
MRI Brain, CSF PCR for
Herpes simplex encephalitis,
JE serology, EEG, Dengue
serology and NS1 testing, HIV
testing

### OPTIONAL
CSF Neurovirology panel, anti-NMDA receptor antibody
testing, PCR viral testing of other samples (throat swab,
nasopharyngeal aspirates, stool etc), Blood Tandem Mass
Spectrometry and urine gas chromatography, antinuclear
antibodies

*Lumbar puncture is contra-indicated or neuroimaging must be obtained before lumbar puncture
1.Fundus: papilledema 2. Platelet count < 50,000 3. Focal neurological deficits 4. Asymmetric/unreactive pupils 5.Decerebrate/decorticate posturing

## MANAGEMENT

All patients need to be admitted.

If any of the following signs are present, the child should be referred to tertiary care facility with PICU and facilities for mechanical ventilation:
Glasgow Coma Scale < 8. Abnormal breathing pattern. Shock not responding to fluid bolus. Decerebrate or decorticate posturing
Seizures persisting despite benzodiazepine and phenytoin

### Step I: Rapid assessment and stabilization
*   Establish and maintain airway: Intubate if GCS<8,
    impaired airway reflexes, abnormal respiratory pattern,
    signs of raised intracranial pressure, SpO2 <92% despite
    high flow oxygen and fluid refractory shock
*   Ventilation, oxygenation
*   Circulation: Establish IV access, take samples for
    relevant investigations, Fluid bolus if in circulatory
    failure (20 mL/kg NS), inotropes if required
*   Identify signs of cerebral herniation or raised ICP
*   Temperature: treat fever and hypothermia
*   Treat ongoing seizures- Benzodiazepine, followed by
    phenytoin loading

### Step V: Prevention/treatment of complications and
rehabilitation
*   Physiotherapy, posture change, prevent bed sores and
    exposure keratitis
*   Complications: aspiration pneumonia, nosocomial
    infections, coagulation disturbances
*   Nutrition: early feeding
*   Psychological support to patient and family

### #Management of raised intracranial pressure
Intubate if: GCS <8 / evidence of herniation / irregular respirations and inability to
maintain airway
Signs of impending herniation: patient to be hyperventilated to a target PaCO2 of
30-35 mmHg
Initial bolus of Mannitol (0.25 g/kg), then 0.25 g/kg q 6 h as per requirement, up to 48
hours.
In the presence of hypotension, hypovolemia, and renal failure: hypertonic (3%) saline
(preferable to mannitol) 0.1-1 mL/kg/hr by infusion; serum sodium to be targeted to
145-155 meq/L
Adequate sedation and analgesia
Avoid noxious stimuli
Administer nebulized lignocaine prior to endotracheal tube suctioning

### Step II: History, Examination and Investigations as given above

### Step III: Empirical Treatment (must be started if CSF cannot be
done/report will take time and patient sick)
*   Ceftriaxone: 100 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses X 10-14 days
*   Acyclovir (use in all suspected sporadic viral encephalitis):
    *   3 mo to 12 y: 500mg/m2 8 hourly (min 21 days)
    *   \>12 y: 10mg/Kg 8 hourly (14-21 days in confirmed cases)**
*   Artesunate combination therapy (stop if peripheral smear and RDT are
    negative): 3mg/kg in child <20 kg, and 2.4mg/kg in child > 20kg IV/IM at
    0, 12 and 24 hours, followed by once daily parental/oral X 3-7 days

**If therapy was started empirically stop acyclovir, in case an alternative diagnosis is
confirmed, or HSV PCR of CSF is negative on two occasions (24-48 h apart) and MRI
imaging not suggestive of Herpes Simplex Encephalitis

### Step IV: Supportive care and treatment
*   Maintain euglycemia, hydration and control fever
*   Treat raised intracranial pressure#, mild head-end elevation-15-30°
*   Treat seizures##; Give anticonvulsant if: history of seizures / GCS <8 /
    child has features of raised ICP
*   Steroids: Pulse steroids (methylprednisolone) to be given in children
    with suspected acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or autoimmune
    encephalitis

### ##Treatment of seizures
*   1st Line: IV Lorazepam 0.1mg/kg or Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg
    orDiazepam 0.3 mg/kg).
*   If no IV access: IM Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg
*   2nd Line: Inj. Phenytoin 20 mg/kg (in Normal saline
    1mg/kg/min)
*   If seizures still persist:
*   Refractory status: Transfer to PICU -> midazolam infusion
    (1-18 microgram/kg/min)
*   If ICU facilities not available: sodium valproate (20 mg/kg)
    or
    levetiracetam (20-40 mg/kg) or phenobarbitone (20mg/kg)

## DISCHARGE CRITERIA

| Hemodynamically stable | Improvement in consciousness | Afebrile | Has started eating and drinking orally | Seizures have subsided | Parents have been explained the supportive care and physiotherapy to be continued at home |
