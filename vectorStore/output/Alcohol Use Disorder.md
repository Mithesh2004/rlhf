*   Complications:
    *   Physical- gastritis, peripheral neuropathy, hepatic dysfunction, accidents/injuries
    *   Psychosocial - loss of work, fights at home, financial, legal problems

### EXAMINATION

| VITALS | WITHDRAWAL SIGNS | SIGNS OF HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION | NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS |
|---|---|---|---|
| BP | Tremor | Enlarged liver | Cerebellar signs |
| Pulse Rate | Sweating | Icterus | Peripheral neuropathy |
| Temperature | Tachycardia | Abdominal swelling | Confusion |

### DIAGNOSIS
Alcohol dependence (three of the following six criteria to be present for at least one month)

1.  A strong desire or sense of compulsion to take alcohol
2.  Difficulty in controlling alcohol use

*   Blood sugar

*   CT head (in case of seizure/ delirium tremens)

```

#### PRIMARY CARE
*   Alcohol Hazardous/ Harmful users - Brief Intervention* to reduce/stop consumption
*   Alcohol Dependent users - Advice to stop use and motivate for treatment using Brief intervention*

#### SECONDARY CARE
*   Treatment of withdrawal symptoms
*   Managment of withdrawal seizure
*   Inpatient management with benzodiazepines (diazepam or lorazepam)
*   Frequent titration of medication. Higher dosage may be required.
*   Closer monitoring and nursing care
*   Treatment of additional psychiatric disorder or substance use disorder

#### TERTIARY CARE
*   Treatment of delirium tremens
*   R/ o head injury, hepatic encephalopathy, Wernicke's encephalopathy
*   R/ o other causes of delirium
*   Manage on similar lines as withdrawal seizures
*   Management in ICU setting when indicated
*   Consult with other medical specialists (like gastroenterology or medicine for hematemesis).
*   Management for suicidality or violence when emergent threat

#### *BRIEF INTERVENTION
Inquire using open ended questions in a non-judgmental manner. Help patient to evaluate the risks versus the perceived benefits and to arrive at a decision to reduce or stop alcohol use.
Includes (FRAMES):
*   Feedback about alcohol related problems
*   Responsibility - acknowledging that the patient is responsible for making the decision about their alcohol use
*   Advice regarding the harms associated with continued use
*   Menu of alternative change options (includes identifying alternative activities such as hobbies, involving the family in treatment)
*   Empathetic attitude
*   Self efficacy - to encourage patients' confidence that they can make changes in their alcohol use and lifestyle

#### WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT
*   Tab Diazepam (20-40mg/day in divided doses) based on severity of withdrawals. Monitor and titrate dose.
*   If patient comfortable, reduce dose of medication by 10% to 20% per day, taper within 7 to 10 days
*   Thiamine 100 mg OD
*   Significant liver dysfunction: Lorazepam (2 mg Lorazepam equal to 5 mg Diazepam)

#### RELAPSE PREVENTION
(Long term goals- abstinence and socio-occupational integration)
*   Disulfiram (250 mg OD)

##### Pre-requisites:
*   Motivated patient
*   Patient's written consent
*   Under supervision of family members.
*   Inform patient and family about unpleasant, potentially serious reaction with even small amounts of alcohol (flushing, headache, vomiting, reduction of blood pressure, arrhythmias)
*   Ability of health personnel in the area to handle a potential reaction
*   Relapse prevention counselling:
*   Identify cues leading to craving (like person, place, situation etc)
*   Develop strategies to deal with them effectively

### INDICATIONS FOR ADMISSION
