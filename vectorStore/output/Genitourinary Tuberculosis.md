# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**GENITOURINARY TUBERCULOSIS**
ICD-A18.10

## WHEN TO SUSPECT?
- Fever
- Weight loss
- Night sweats

## PRESENTING SYMPTOMS

### Urinary Tuberculosis
- **LUTS** (frequency, urgency and nocturia) with dysuria and/or haematuria for at least 2 weeks
- Not responding to a 3-7 day course of antibiotics

### Male Genital Tuberculosis (MGTB)
- Scrotal pain or swelling for 2 weeks or more
- Not responding to a 7-14 day course of antibiotics, or
- Discharging sinuses in the scrotum
- Rarely infertility

## INVESTIGATION

### Essential
- CBC
- KFT*
- LFT
- ESR
- Chest X ray
- Urine R/M and Culture
- Urine for AFB x 3-5 days (early morning, first void)
- Urine Culture for MTB x 3-5 days (early morning, first void)
- NAAT assay (GeneXpert MTB/RIF)
- USG KUB**
- USG Scrotum (for MGTB only)

### *Deranged renal function **HDN/HDUN**

### Specific Investigations
- If normal renal function
    - IVP/CT urography
- If deranged Renal Function
    - MR Urogram
    - Retrograde Pyelography
    - Nephrostogram

### Optional (If other tests are inconclusive with high suspicion of GUTB)
- FNAC/Biopsy- from accessible mass lesions or fluid collections
- Cystoscopic biopsy of Genitourinary tract

## TREATMENT

| TYPE OF TB | TYPE OF REGIMEN | DRUGS | EXTENSION CRITERIA |
|---|---|---|---|
| DRUG SUSCEPTIBLE TB | DS-TB REGIMEN | 2 MONTHS H,R,E,Z <br> 4 MONTHS H,R,E | Extension packets of infection, concurrent smear positive cavitary pulmonary disease, CNS involvement, Delay in positive cultures converting to negative <br> Duration can be increased up to 9 to 12 months |
| MDR/RR OR XDR-TB | TREATMENT AS PER NTEP GUIDELINES |

## FOLLOW UP

- **At 8 weeks**: Resolution of systemic symptoms, improved urinary symptoms, repeat culture if baseline culture positive
- **After completion of ATT**: Repeat culture if baseline culture positive
- **Repeat imaging**: If partial or impending ureteric stricture
- **Watch for the following complications at each Follow-up visit**:
    - Severe **LUTS** suggestive of small capacity bladder
    - Deteriorating renal function
