# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**FEMALE GENITAL TUBERCULOSIS**
ICD-10-A18.17

WHEN TO
SUSPECT?

## SUSPECT
Consider following symptoms
in history:
*   H/O **infertility** (primary or secondary)
*   Chronic lower **abdominal** or **pelvic pain**
*   **Amenorrhoea** or other **menstrual disturbances**
*   **Abnormal vaginal discharge**
*   **Constitutional symptoms** of **TB** (low grade fever, weight loss etc.)
*   Other symptoms related to extra-genital **TB** (abdominal, CNS, bone and lymph nodes etc.)

In addition, standard
investigations for **TB** to
be carried out

## Clinical Examination
*   General **Physical Examination**
*   **Pelvic Examination** (cervical growth, uterine size and mobility, adnexal tenderness & mass)

## Abdominal and Pelvic USG (TVS)
*   Uterus, adnexa & pelvis to be evaluated preferably by transvaginal scan
*   Endometrial cavity & vascularity to be looked carefully with colour Doppler

## Specific Investigations
*   **Endometrial sampling** or **biopsy** with Pipelle device or Karman cannula (4 mm) for microbiological & histopathological examination
*   **Endoscopy**:
    *   **Hysteroscopy & laparoscopy** to evaluate uterus, adnexa & other pelvic organs along with lower abdomen
    *   **Laparoscopic biopsy** from peritoneum or abdominal/pelvic lesions
*   **MTB diagnosis** from biopsy specimen (endometrium & other tissues) by
    *   Smear microscopy (**AFB** smear) & culture
    *   Gene Xpert or other **NAAT**
    *   HPE of biopsy specimen

## SUGGESTIVE FINDINGS IN FGTB
### Imaging and Radiological
*   HSG: to be avoided in acute phase
    *   Findings: blocked fallopian tubes, usually cornual; tobacco pouch appearance of the tubes; beaded tubes; filling defect in the uterine cavity (Asherman syndrome)
*   USG : cogwheel appearance of tubes; uterine cavity may show thin diffuse endometrium with irregular borders
*   CT/MRI: can be used for tubo-ovarian mass

### Endoscopy
*   Hysteroscopy: To look for tubercles, pale endometrium & endometrial adhesions
*   Laparoscopy: Direct visualization of tubercle like lesions on the uterus, tubes and other pelvic organs including peritoneum, & caseous nodules

## DIAGNOSIS
**FEMALE GENITAL TB (STEPWISE DECISION)**

*   Clinical history
*   General physical and pelvic examination
*   Pelvic ultrasound
*   HSP as indicated in infertility HSG
*   **Definite FGTB** needing **ATT** if any of the following tests are positive
    *   **AFB** microscopy positive
    *   **AFB** culture positive
    *   Gene Xpert or other **NAAT +ve**
    *   Histopathological demonstration of epithelioid granuloma
*   **Probable FGTB** needing **ATT** if any of following positive
    *   Clinical findings/suspicion of **TB** with tubo-ovarian masses on Imaging studies
    *   Clinical findings/suspicion of **TB** with laparoscopic findings of beaded tubes, caseous nodules, tubercles, adhesions, hydrosalpinx & pyosalpinx etc.
    *   Clinical findings/suspicion of TB with hysteroscopic findings of tubercles, caseous nodules, pale endometrium, intrauterine adhesions etc.
*   **Negative FGTB**: No **ATT**
    *   No microbiological, histological, radiological, laparoscopic & hysteroscopic evidence of **FGTB**
    *   Menstrual blood should not be used for **NAAT**.

## TREATMENT
*   Treatment of **FGTB** should be as per **NTEP**
*   Patients requiring specific treatment such as infertility, Asherman syndrome & tubo-ovarian mass etc. should be referred to higher centres

## MANAGEMENT
## FOLLOW UP
Follow-up of the patient should be flexible depending on the clinical presentation and response to **ATT**
*   1 month: Clinical Evaluation (General & Gynaecological)
*   3 months: Clinical Evaluation (General & Gynaecological)
*   6 months: Clinical Evaluation & Investigations (endometrial biopsy, hystero-laparoscopy & USG as needed)
