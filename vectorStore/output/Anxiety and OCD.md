    trains, buses, planes etc.)

*   **Panic Disorder:** Recurrent unexpected
    attacks of intense fear/ anxiety along with
    physical symptoms (palpitations, feelings of
    "choking", trembling, chest pain feeling
    dizzy/faint etc.)

*   **Social Phobia:** Marked fear and avoidance of

    behaviours (e.g., excessive washing /
    cleaning, checking, ordering etc.)

    day-to-day functioning

    pheochromocytoma
    and hypoglycaemia
*   Psychosocial factors:

    other issues pertaining
    to work, family

## MANAGEMENT

### PRIMARY CARE LEVEL

*   **Psychoeducation**
    **Reassurance**
    *   Explain symptoms are of anxiety/ fear and mimic
        symptoms of physical illnesses (e.g., heart attack)
    *   Do not investigate excessively. Few investigations
        like ECG, ECHO maybe necessary in some patients
    *   Discourage doctor shopping
    *   Do not avoid triggers of panic attacks (e.g., physical
        exertion, agoraphobic situations) and fear (e.g.,
        travelling by public transport).
    *   Emphasize avoidance maintains fears and phobias.
    *   OCD: Educate that the unwanted thoughts are a
        part of illness, and not a reflection of character or
        hidden intentions.

*   **Pharmacological treatment**
    Mild illness: Spending time, reassurance, and
    psychoeducation. May not need any medications.
    No improvement (few weeks): Escitalopram 5mg /
    day at night, with increase to 10 mg/d in a week.
    No satisfactory improvement in 4-6 weeks, may
    increase to 20 mg / day. If there is no significant
    improvement in another 4-6 weeks, refer to a
    specialist.
    Severe and unbearable anxiety: Diazepam (5-10
    mg) may be given at night. Do not continue for > 1
    month. Taper and stop over 2 weeks. Long-term
    treatment with benzodiazepines to be avoided
    Escitalopram to be continued for at least 1-2 years
    after remission
    Side-effects (sexual dysfunction, sedation, weight
    gain): monitor and address periodically

### SECONDARY CARE LEVEL
(DISTRICT HOSPITAL)

*   Review diagnosis and treatment
    history if there is no improvement
    with a trial of Escitalopram.
    Check whether the patient has
    taken medication at prescribed
    dose and on a regular basis

*   **Second SSRI**
    (either of them for about 2-3
    months):

    *   Sertraline upto 200 mg/day,
    *   Fluoxetine upto 60 mg/day,
    *   Paroxetine upto 50 mg/day,
    *   Fluvoxamine upto 300 mg/day

*   No response to second SSRI:
    cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)
    if trained therapists available.

*   Refer to tertiary centre if
    unsatisfactory response after
    second SSRI and / or addition of
    CBT.

*   If referral to tertiary centre is not
    feasible, psychiatrists may try
    other strategies (other than Deep
    Brain Stimulation and surgery for
    OCD) mentioned under the
    "tertiary care" at the secondary
    level itself.

### TERTIARY CENTRE (MEDICAL COLLEGE,
REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTRE, PSYCHIATRIC
HOSPITAL)

*   Evaluate reasons for treatment resistance like
    Wrong diagnosis
    Inadequate drug treatment,
    Poor adherence to treatment
    Inadequate CBT,
    Presence of comorbid conditions such as
    personality disorders and organicity

*   Panic disorder: evaluate any medical
    conditions that mimic panic disorder
    (hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism,
    pheochromocytoma, vestibular diseases,
    seizures, arrhythmias, etc.).

*   OCD: Trial of third SSRI or clomipramine
*   Treatment resistant OCD: inpatient treatment
    for intensive therapist-assisted daily CBT and
    for rationalization of medication regimen.
*   Other anxiety disorders: Trial of non-SSRIS
    (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine, pregabalin etc.)
    and tricyclic antidepressants

*   If response to medications is poor or
    unsatisfactory:

    *   CBT is the preferred mode of treatment
        alone or in combination with medications.
    *   Treat comorbid psychiatric disorders (e.g.,
        personality disorders)
    *   Pharmacological augmenting strategies if
        antidepressants and CBT do not provide
        relief.
