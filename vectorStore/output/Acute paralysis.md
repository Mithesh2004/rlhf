    A[Are There Any Signs Of Upper Motor Neuron (UMN)

    • Extensor plantar
    • Increased tone
    • Sensory level
    • Bladder or bowel incontinence] --> B{NO};
    A --> C{YES};
    B --> D[Is the weakness predominantly
    proximal or distal?];
    D --> E[WEAKNESS
    PROXIMAL];
    D --> F[WEAKNESS

    E --> G[REFLEXES
    ABSENT];
    E --> H[REFLEXES
    PRESENT];
    F --> I[Presence of Lower Motor Neuron
    (LMN) signs like wasting, absent
    reflexes and sensory impairment
    Likely to be:
    Acute onset peripheral neuropathy
    (due to toxin/drug)
    MANAGEMENT
    • Transfer/refer to nearest district
    hospital/medical college with
    NCS and EMG facilities.
    • CSF for cells and biochemistry
    • Treatment as per diagnosis
    • After treatment follow up at CHC
    for medications and

    Acute myelopathy like
    tuberculosis
    • Trauma
    • Tumor
    • Transverse myelitis
    Epidural abscess
    • Spinal cord stroke
    MANAGEMENT
    Check pulse, BP and respiration
    • If retention of urine present
    then catheterize
    • Transfer/refer to nearest district
    hospital/medical college with
    MRI facility
    • Treatment will depend on MRI
    and other investigation
    • After treatment follow up at
    CHC for medications and
    rehabilitation];
    G --> K[Likely to be :
    • Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) or
    • Hypokalemic periodic paralysis.];
    H --> L[MANAGEMENT
    • Check pulse BP and respiration
    • Check serum K+ levels
    • Intubate if unable to complete
    sentences, single breath count low
    and breath holding time low and
    chest expansion poor
    • Transfer/refer to nearest District
    Hospital/medical college with
    facility for doing plasma exchange
    or giving IVIg and presence of
    ventilator.
    • After treatment follow up at CHC
    for medications and rehabilitation];
    J --> M{If the weakness is fatigable
    or
    If extra ocular movements are
    affected};
    M --> N[Likely to be :
    • Myasthenia gravis or
    • Snake bite];
    J --> O{If no sensory impairment and
    normal extra ocular movements};
    O --> P[Likely to be :
    • Myopathy (eg polymyositis)];
    N --> Q[MANAGEMENT
    • Check pulse, BP and respiration
    • Intubate if unable to complete
    sentences, single breath count low
    and breath holding time low and
    chest expansion poor
    • Transfer/refer to nearest district
    hospital/medical college with
    facility for doing NCS, plasma
    exchange or giving IVIg and
    presence of ventilator.
    • After treatment follow up at CHC for
    medications and rehabilitation];
        P --> R[MANAGEMENT
    • Check pulse, BP and respiration
    • Check serum electrolytes, creatine
    kinase
    • Transfer/refer to nearest district
    hospital/medical college with
    facility for NCS & EMG
    • After treatment follow up at CHC
    for medications and rehabilitation];
