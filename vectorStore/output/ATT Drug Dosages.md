# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) Guidelines for
**DRUG SENSITIVE-TB TREATMENT AS PER NΤΕΡ**

*   For all TB patients whether being treated in public or private sector, clinicians should follow Standards for TB care in India guidelines
*   In **NTEP**, the principle of TB treatment (except confirmed **DR-TB**) is to administer daily **FDC** of 1st line **ATT** in appropriate weight bands, under direct observation
*   For patients being treated in private sector, **FDCs** may be provided by **NTEP** whenever requested

## Regimen for Drug-Sensitive TB cases: 2HRZE/4HRE

*   This regimen is for **H & R** sensitive TB cases and cases where the sensitivity pattern can not be established
*   Treatment is given in two phases:

    1.  Intensive phase consists of 8 weeks (56 doses) of **isoniazid (H)**, **rifampicin (R)**, **pyrazinamide (Z)** and **ethambutol (E)** given under direct observation in daily dosages as per weight band categories
    2.  Continuation phase consists of 16 weeks (112 doses) of **isoniazid**, **rifampicin** and **ethambutol** in daily dosages. Only pyrazinamide will be stopped in the continuation phase. The **CP** needs to be extended upto 24 weeks in certain forms of TB like **CNS TB**, **Skeletal TB**. In disseminated TB or slow response treating physician may extend on case to case basis.

| Regimen for DS-TB |        |        |
| :---------------- | :----- | :----- |
| Drugs             | **IP** | **CP** |
| Doses             | 2 **HRZE** | 4 **HRE** |
|                   | 56     | 112    |

    *   Discharge on oral steroids on tapering doses for total duration of 8-12 weeks
    *   Regular follow up is essential every month for at least first 3 months & can be increased thereafter till treatment is stopped
    *   Monitor liver function tests & any other features of drug toxicity
    *   Observe for clinical improvement or any deterioration
    *   Closely observe for development of any complications

*treatment duration may be increased in some cases as per the clinician decision

### Special considerations for Adult abdominal TB

*   Extend duration of treatment in cases of inadequate response
*   Refer for surgical management for complications [intestinal obstruction (due to strictures), perforation]
*   Consider endoscopic dilatation for treatment for accessible strictures
*   Refer for biliary drainage in case of Jaundice due to biliary obstruction (hepatobiliary obstruction/pancreatic TB)

### Special considerations for intra-ocular TB

*   **ATT**: 2 months of **RHEZ** + 7 months of **RH** depending on clinical response & side effects to treatment
*   Add pyridoxine 10 mg/day
*   Corticosteroids: Topical steroids eye drops for severe/anterior chamber inflammation
*   For treatment in children refer to paediatrician
*   Systemic corticosteroids for severe inflammation in consultation with Uveitits expert

### Special considerations for paediatric osteoarticular TB

Regimen: 2**HRZE** + 10**HRE**

Follow up every month during treatment & subsequently every 3 months: Potts spine with X-ray or **MRI** & Tubercular dactylitis or arthritis with plain X-ray

### Special considerations for paediatric Abdominal TB

*   Steroids- Not recommended
*   Supportive treatment- Management of **SAM/Malnutrition** as per national guidelines
*   Surgical treatment:
    *   Acute intestinal obstruction, Bowel perforation
    *   Persistence of obstructive symptoms despite conservative management & **ATT**
