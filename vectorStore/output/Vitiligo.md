# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## VITILIGO
### ICD-10-L80

Vitiligo is an acquired skin disease characterized by **depigmented (white) macules**, with a global prevalence of 1-2%

### NON-SEGMENTAL VITILIGO

**GENERALIZED VITILIGO**
*   Lesions in a generalized distribution, usually affecting trunk, extremities and face
*   No predilection for any specific site; also called **vitiligo vulgaris**

**ACROFACIAL VITILIGO**
*   Affects the distal extremities and/or face/genitals
*   Less responsive to treatment

**OTHER VARIANTS**
*   Focal
*   Follicular
*   Mucosal
*   Universal ≥ 80% of body surface area involvement

### SEGMENTAL VITILIGO
*   Unilateral with a midline demarcation
*   Onset in childhood
*   Leucotrichia both within and beyond the lesion
*   Usually stabilizes within a year after an initial period of progression
*   Response to medical treatment is variable and most patients may require surgical treatment

**GENERALIZED VITILIGO**

**Progressive vitiligo with Koebner's phenomenon**

**ACROFACIAL VITILIGO**

**UNIVERSAL VITILIGO**

**SEGMENTAL VITILIGO**

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT
*   Diagnosis is clinical
*   Educate patient about the disease
*   Assess the psychosocial impact of vitiligo and counsel about the variable/ unpredictable course of disease & expected response to treatment
*   In pregnancy, prefer only topical corticosteroids
*   Decide the treatment plan based on
    *   A. Disease activity
        *   ► Progressive: new lesions, or spread of existing lesions
            *   → Rapidly progressive: >5 new lesions in last 1 month, or >15 lesions in last 3 months
            *   → Slowly progressive: <5 new lesions in last 1 month, or < 15 lesions in last 3 months
        *   ► Stable: no new lesions, no spread of existing lesions
    *   B. Extent of involvement: limited (≤5%) or extensive (>5%)
*   Limited stable/slowly progressive vitiligo:
    *   → Topical treatment- Mid-potent/potent corticosteroids, tacrolimus, topical **PUVA/PUVAsol** (Avoid prolonged use)
*   Extensive stable/slowly progressive vitiligo:
    *   → Narrow-band ultraviolet B (NbUVB), oral Psoralen + Ultraviolet A (PUVA)/PUVAsol
*   Rapidly progressive vitiligo (limited or extensive):
    *   → Oral corticosteroids (minipulse) and/or
    *   → Azathioprine/ Methotrexate
*   Non-responders:
    *   > Consider combining different modalities if unsatisfactory response with monotherapy
    *   > Consider surgical treatment for stable limited vitiligo/ segmental vitiligo (unresponsive to medical treatment)
    *   > Consider camouflage for poorly responsive vitiligo lesions
*   Monitoring of patients on systemic treatment
    *   > Height (children), weight, blood pressure and blood sugar in patients on oral corticosteroids
    *   Complete Hemogram, Liver Function Test in patients on drugs such as Azathioprine, Methotrexate

## COMMON DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES
*   **Leprosy**
    *   > Hypopigmented, not depigmented macules
    *   > Overlying sensory loss
    *   > Enlarged peripheral nerves
*   **Pityriasis alba**
    *   > Hypopigmented scaly lesions usually on a child's face
*   **Nevus depigmentosus**
    *   > Present since birth or early childhood
    *   > Single hypopigmented macule/segmental lesion

## IMPORTANT COUNSELLING POINTS
*   Not the same as leprosy
*   Does not spread by touch
*   Not caused by certain foods such as milk, curd, lemon, fish etc
*   Treatment is available for vitiligo
*   Multifactorial, predominantly autoimmune

VITILIGO CAN BE TREATED. TREATMENT DEPENDS ON EXTENT AND ACTIVITY OF DISEASE

This STW has been prepared by national experts of India with feasibility considerations for various levels of healthcare system in the country. These broad guidelines are advisory, and
are based on expert opinions and available scientific evidence. There may be variations in the management of an individual patient based on his/her specific condition, as decided by
the treating physician. There will be no indemnity for direct or indirect consequences. Kindly visit the website of DHR for more information: (stw.icmr.org.in) for more information.
