# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## IMAGE GUIDED MANAGEMENT OF HAEMOPTYSIS
ICD-10-R04.2

### INTRODUCTION
**Haemoptysis** refers to the expectoration of blood, originating from the lower respiratory tract
**LTH** - Any haemoptysis that
*   (1) is > 100 ml in 24 hr
*   (2) causes respiratory failure (SpO2 < 60%) necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation; or
*   (3) causes haemodynamic instability
**LTH** is a respiratory emergency, mortality 50-100%
Patient dies because of asphyxiation and not exsanguination
Optimal diagnosis and treatment mortality < 20%

### ETIOLOGY AND SOURCE OF HAEMOPTYSIS
**Pulmonary parenchymal source (65 - 79%)**
*   Tubercular Pneumonia
*   Lung abscess
*   Mycetoma ("fungus ball")

**Tracheobronchial source (31-57%)**
*   Bronchiectasis
*   Neoplasm

**Primary vascular source (1-5%)**
*   Arteriovenous malformation
*   Pulmonary embolism
*   Pulmonary artery aneurysm/rupture

**Cardiac source (1-5%)**
*   Mitral Stenosis
*   Pulmonary Edema
*   CHD with MAPCAS

**Miscellaneous and rare causes**
*   Systemic coagulopathy or thrombolytic agents

```

### ROLE OF BRONCHOSCOPY
**Bronchoscopy** may be used for
*   Lateralization of bleeding (active haemoptysis within 24-48 hrs)
*   Clot extraction
*   Balloon tamponade

### SURGERY FOR SEVERE/REFRACTORY HAEMOPTYSIS
*   Cavitating lesion with fungal ball
*   In unsuitable anatomy/not amenable for angioembolization/unsuccessful embolization
*   > 600 ml/24 hours
*   Surgeries: Lobectomy, Pneumonectomy, Cavernostomy
*   Large cavity in a patient with very poor pulmonary functions and massive bleeding → Resection and a cavernostomy with cauterization of the bleeding point and packing of the cavity

# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## IMAGE GUIDED MANAGEMENT OF HAEMOPTYSIS
(Continued)

### ANGIOGRAPHIC AND CT APPEARANCE OF ABNORMAL BRONCHIAL
### ARTERIES-INDICATIONS FOR BAE
1.  Hypervascularity of lung parenchyma (most common)
2.  Hypertrophic tortuous bronchial or non-bronchial arteries (common)
3.  Neovascularisation (common) or peri-bronchial hypervascularity
4.  Enlarged main bronchial artery (diameter > 2.0 mm)
5.  Contrast extravasation (variable)
6.  Bronchial artery aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm (rare)
7.  Bronchial-to-pulmonary vein-shunts
8.  Pleural thickening > 3 mm adjacent to a parenchymal abnormality
9.  Extrapleural fat hypertrophy including enlarged vascular structures
10. 10% of BA may arise from Brachiocephalic, SCA, IMA or abdominal aorta branches

### PROCEDURE DETAILS OF BAE
Pre op CTA/Flush DTA and B/L SCA Aortogram

### CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR BRONCHIAL
### ARTERY EMBOLIZATION
*   Documented severe iodinated contrast allergy
*   Careful to exclude branches supplying the heart, spinal cord or brain arising from bronchial, intercostal or other non-bronchial vessels
*   Congenital PA stenosis (bronchial collateral vessels may provide an essential role in pulmonary parenchymal perfusion)

Locate Hypertrophied BAs, search and hook with diagnostic cobra/simmons catheter

Selective hand-injection angiogram verification of absence of any branches supplying to critical structures

Advance coaxial microcatheter in target vessel distally and access flow dynamics by angiogram through 2CC luer lock syringe

Embolization by pulsatile injection through 1 cc syringe under active fluoroscopy

When resistance/reflux develops, new manual contrast angiogram to be done after flushing residual embolic materials
Locate other BAs and NBSAs and embolise all pathological arteries

### EXPECTED OUTCOMES
*   Technical success: 90-100%
*   Clinical success
    *   Within 24 hr- 82-100%; within 30 days-70-92%;
    *   1-yr clinical success- 64-92%
    *   Recurrence: upto 47% [Repeat Embolization to be performed]
    *   Predictors of recurrent Haemoptysis are as follows:
        *   Recruitment of non-bronchial systemic collaterals
        *   Diabetes
        *   Presence of an aspergilloma
        *   Feeding vessels from internal mammary artery
        *   Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, co-existent pulmonary
            interstitial lung disease, patients with malignant diseases
        *   Unstable haemodynamics and prolonged coagulation

### Associated adverse events/complications
*   Post embolization syndrome-1.7-31%
*   Spinal cord Infarction, bronchial infarction, stroke <1%

### After care
*   Pain management: NSAIDS and if required intravenous Narcotics
*   Follow up:
    *   After 1 week; 1, 3, 6, and 12months post-BAE and yearly thereafter
    *   Hb
    *   Chest Xray
