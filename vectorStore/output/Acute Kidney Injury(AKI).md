## WHAT IS AKI?
Increase in Serum creatinine by >0.3 mg/dl in 48 hours
AND/OR Urine output <0.5 ml/kg/h for 6-12 hours

## SYMPTOMS
*   Reduced urine output
*   Dark, concentrated urine
*   Swelling over feet/face
*   Breathlessness

## LOOK OUT FOR AKI IN THE PRESENCE OF
*   **Hypotension**
*   Volume loss (eg: vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding); heat exposure or heat stroke
*   Pregnancy-related complications
*   Multiple organ failure
*   Nephrotoxic medication use
*   In neonates - oligohydramnios/ birth asphyxia, respiratory distress

## PRINCIPLES OF ASSESSMENT
*   Determine whether pre-renal, renal or post-renal
*   Identify and correct reversible factors
*   Look out for occult causes (e.g. envenomations, poisoning)
*   Determine severity of AKI
*   Identify complications
*   Decide need for dialysis

## PRELIMINARY ACTIONS
*   Monitor urine volume & body weight
*   Identify and treat life-threatening complications
*   Correct hydration status
*   Stop nephrotoxic drugs
*   Exclude urinary outlet obstruction
*   Stabilize blood pressure
*   Treat infection
*   Assess for dialysis need

## DESIRABLE ACTIONS/INVESTIGATIONS
*   Stage AKI (KDIGO criteria*)
*   Check electrolytes, acid-base status
*   Urinalysis
*   Rule out pre-existing kidney disease
*   Ultrasound of KUB region
*   Assessment for infection
*   Laboratory investigation for specific cause

## AKI IN SPECIFIC SETTINGS
*   Neonatal - refer to paediatrician
*   Pregnancy - manage complications
*   Envenomations - antivenin, hemodynamic correction
*   Poisoning - specific antidote when available
*   Systemic disease - refer for investigations
*   Kidney transplant recipient - refer to nephrologist

## TREATMENT OF HYPERKALEMIA
*   Calcium gluconate 1000 mg slow IV under ECG monitoring, can be repeated upto 3 times
*   Salbutamol: 10 to 20 mg in 4 mL of saline by nebulization
*   Insulin-dextrose: 10 to 20 units of regular insulin in 100 ml 25% or 50% dextrose

## MANAGEMENT

### PRIMARY CARE
*   Detailed history and physical examination
*   Identify and correct volume deficit
*   Stop nephrotoxic agents
*   Identify and correct bladder outlet obstruction
*   Give anti-snake venom if indicated
*   Identify hyperkalemia and start treatment
*   Identify pulmonary edema- start intravenous furosemide and oxygen
*   PD if indicated
*   Timely referral after stabilisation

### SECONDARY CARE
*   Detailed history and physical examination
*   Identify and correct volume deficit
*   Stop nephrotoxic agents
*   Identify and treat hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and pulmonary edema
*   Identify and correct urinary tract obstruction (USG, CT)
*   Detailed investigation for infections
*   Manage pregnancy complications deliver if indicated
*   Look for underlying CKD
*   Dialysis (PD or HD)

### TERTIARY CARE
*   Detailed history and physical examination
*   Identify and correct volume deficit
*   Stop nephrotoxic agents
*   Identify and correct urinary tract obstruction (USG, CT scan)
*   Identify and treat hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and pulmonary oedema
*   Detailed investigation for infections
*   Manage pregnancy complications- deliver if indicated
*   Look for underlying CKD
*   Investigations for specific cause (including imaging, genetic tests)
*   Kidney biopsy
*   Dialysis (PD or HD)

## RED FLAGS FOR URGENT REFERRAL
*   Unexplained AKI
*   Involvement of other organs
*   Sepsis
*   Systemic disease
*   Complicated pregnancy

## INDICATIONS FOR DIALYSIS
*   Fluid overload
*   Pericarditis
*   **Hyperkalemia**
*   Severe metabolic acidosis
*   Encephalopathy
*   Severe uraemia
*   To create space for fluids or blood products

## FOLLOW-UP OF AKI
*   UO > 1L, stable or falling creatinine, no symptoms: stop dialysis
*   Not resolving for >2 weeks: CECT to exclude cortical necrosis; kidney biopsy as indicated
*   Look for systemic diseases (e.g. vasculitis, myeloma, TMA)
*   Serum creatinine and urine protein q 6-12 months for life

## ABBREVIATIONS
AKI: Acute Kidney Injury
PD: Peritoneal dialysis
CECT: Contrast-enhanced CT scan
TMA: Thrombitic microangiopathy
CKD: Chronic Kidney Disease
HD: Hemodialysis
UO: Urine output
USG: Ultrasonography

## KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES
This STW has been prepared by national experts of India with feasibility considerations for various levels of healthcare system in the country. These broad guidelines are advisory, and are based on expert opinions and available scientific evidence. There may be variations in the management of an individual patient based on his/her specific condition, as decided by the treating physician.
