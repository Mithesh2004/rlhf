**BOX A: Risk factors for TB**

*   Contact history with TB case
*   Immunocompromised
*   HIV

**DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM**

**BOX B: Clinical manifestation of Spinal TB (STB) /TB arthritis (TBA)**

*   Insidious onset back pain for >6 weeks (STB)
*   Spine deformity/Kyphoscoliosis/Gibbus/Paraplegia/Sensory loss/Autonomic dysfunction (STB)
*   Insidious onset pain and swelling in joints for >6 weeks (TBA)
*   TB Symptoms: Persistent Fever, Anorexia, Weight loss (>5% in last 3 months)

Suspect if symptoms of STB/TBA present with/without constitutional symptoms of TB (Box B) and/or risk factors of TB

*   X-ray of Spine (AP/Lateral): May show end plate erosions, narrow /collapsed joint space, reduced vertebral height, paravertebral soft tissue shadow. Early stage X-ray may be normal
*   X-ray joints (AP/Lateral): Erosions, sclerosis, calcification or narrow joint space
*   USG abdomen for Iliopsoas Abscess
*   USG joints for joint effusion and diagnostic aspiration
*   Chest X-ray, ESR, blood sugar, HIV

↓

*   MRI Spine (100% sensitive): indicated in all cases: may show
    *   Marrow edema
    *   Destruction of intervertebral disc, adjacent vertebral bodies & opposing end plates
    *   Prevertebral, paravertebral and/or epidural abscesses
*   MRI Joints: Synovial proliferation with periarticular picture s/o TBA

Radiological findings s/o osteoarticular TB and/or TB at additional site- can be labeled as clinically diagnosed Osteoarticular TB

Refer patients to higher centre for biopsy (Percutaneous CT-guided biopsy-preferred or open biopsy) of lesion for cytopathology/ biopsy to confirm diagnosis & DST and to rule out other diseases. (Laboratory confirmed osteoarticular TB) (Risks and benefits of obtaining a biopsy must be considered)

## MANAGEMENT

**TREATMENT & MONTORING**
Start treatment for microbiologically/Lab confirmed TB and probable TB

*   Regimen: **2HRZE + 10HRE** (Standard doses) + **Pyridoxine 10 mg/day**
*   Follow up every month during treatment & subsequently every 3 months: Pott's spine with X-ray or MRI & Tubercular dactylitis or arthritis with plain X-ray
*   Monitor on each visit :
    *   Symptomatic improvement, weight gain, side effects of medicines
    *   Microbiology: sputum/GA if CXR abnormal at end of IP. Site samples like aspiration of pus from lesions including psoas abscess (if worsening of symptoms/poor response)
*   Imaging: MRI/CT/X ray of affected parts: at end of treatment or early if worsening

**Surgical Indications in Potts Spine**

*   Progressive neurological deficit
*   Paraplegia of recent onset or severe paraplegia
*   Persistent pain with spinal instability
*   Spinal deformity-severe kyphotic deformity at presentation, or in children (<10 years of age) at high risk of progression of kyphosis with growth after healing of disease

**WHEN TO REFER**

*   Suspected osteoarticular disease if essential investigations are not available
*   Diagnosis (microbiological or probable) not established by investigations
*   Surgery needed: imaging suggest compressive myelopathy, motor deficits
*   No improvement with appropriate treatment
*   DR TB: diagnosed or high suspiscion

**Confirm microbiologically in all cases, if possible, before ATT**

**OTHER INFORMATION**

*   In case of synovial fluid or cold abscess aspiration (against gravity), send samples for confirmation of TB in following 3 ways
    *   Two dry slide for demonstration of AFB (ZN staining)
    *   Two samples in formalin for histopathological examination
    *   Two samples in saline for culture' followed by DST and/or NAAT
*   Confirmed cases to undergo HIV/blood sugar testing/parent counselling *MGIT/LJ (if MGIT not available)
