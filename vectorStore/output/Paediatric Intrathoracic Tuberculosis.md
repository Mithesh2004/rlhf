# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of PAEDIATRIC INTRATHORACIC TUBERCULOSIS (PULMONARY, PLEURAL, MEDIASTINAL) ICD-10-A15

Documented, persistent unexplained fever for 2 weeks or more

WHEN TO SUSPECT?

Unremitting cough for 2 weeks or more

Unexplained documented weight loss of ≥ 5% in last 3 months

No weight gain despite adequate nutrition

Unexplained loss of appetite

Chest pain (specific to pleural effusion)

Contact with TB patients in past 2 years

## EXAMINATION
*   Temperature, Weight, Mid Arm Circumference (MAC), Lymphadenopathy, cold abscess, discharging sinus
*   Chest examination findings depend upon underlying pathology like consolidation, pleural effusion etc.

## INVESTIGATIONS

### Essential
*   Chest x-ray
    *   TB suggestive: Hilar/ paratracheal lymph nodes, fibrocavitory disease, Miliary pattern
    *   Non Specific: effusion, consolidation, bronchopneumonia, other shadows etc.
*   Sputum/Induced Sputum/Gastric Lavage/ Aspirate/pleural fluid for **NAAT**
Smear examination (if **NAAT** unavailable)
*   If facilities exist, send aliquot of sample for culture, if **NAAT** negative for **MTB**
*   Pleural tap**: Gross, Cytology, Biochemistry, **NAAT**, MGIT/LJ, ZN if **NAAT** not available
**If can't be done at primary level then refer

Do **HIV** testing for all cases with **TB**

## DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM

ALGORITHM FOR PEDIATRIC INTRATHORACICTB AMONG CHILDREN WITH NO RISK FACTORS FOR DRUG RESISTANCE
*   Persistent Fever ≥2weeks, without a known cause and/or
*   Unremitting cough for ≥2weeks and/or
*   Weight loss ≥5%; or no weight gain in past 3 months despite adequate nutrition; or failure of nutritional rehabilitation in babies with SAM
*   With or without contact with patient with Pulmonary TB in past 2 years

### Chest X-ray
CXR suggestive
Sputum/GA/IS for approved **NAAT** for **MTB**

MTB +ve
Microbiologically confirmed TB case
Rif resistance +ve follow DRTB pathway

### Chest X-ray
CXR Non specific shadows

Give antibiotics (Amoxyclav or Amoxicillin & avoid quinolones, linezolid) Skip if already taken
MTB -ve
Persistent shadow & symptoms

Look for significantly enlarged peripheral LN & test LN aspirate for **MTB** Repeat **NAAT** with good sample/ alternative sample (BAL/aspirate) as per feasibility
*   May seek review from a higher centre
    
### Pleural Effusion
Pleural fluid for **NAAT**, cytology, biochemistry & Sputum/GA/IS for **NAAT** for **MTB**

MTB +ve
Microbiologically confirmed TB case
Rif resistance -ve Give 1st line ATT

### CXR Normal
Check for **EPTB**
Needs detailed investigation for TB/ alternate diagnosis. May need CECT chest/other investigations as per symptoms
Consider referral to higher center for further investigations
### No alternative diagnosis
treat as clinically diagnosed probable TB case

### Straw colored, exudative effusion

Clinically diagnosed Pulmonary TB
Drug sensitive previously treated TB (recurrent, failure, treatment after default) *DR TB algorithm-DST

Fibrocavitary shadows Suggestive of **TB**
Miliary Shadows Suggestive of **TB**
Hilar LN enlargement Suggestive of **TB**
Paratracheal LN Suggestive of **TB**

### Desirable
Chest x-ray of family members

### Optional (to be done in institutions)
*   CECT scan
*   Pleural Biopsy
    *   Image guided (USG/CT)
*   mediastinal LN biopsy
*   Bronchoscopy & BAL

### DO NOT DO
*   TST/Mantoux test
    *   Overemphasized, supportive only
    *   Not to diagnose **TB** or to start ATT on basis of +ve TST ONLY
*   Serological tests- IGRA (Quantiferon/Quantiferon-Gold etc)
*   Pleural fluid ADA

## PEDIATRIC TB FURTHER WORK-UP ALGORITHM UNDER U-DST

### Presumed TB cases
MTB -ve
Clinically diagnosed TB case with no risk factors for DRTB
Treat with standard regime 2HRZE/4RHE
Add Pyridoxine 10 mg/day
H Resistant Not detected
NAAT
MTB +ve

Rif resistance -ve Repeat NAAT

Reinvestigate for nonresponse including for DRTB
No response in 4 weeks FL-LPA*

Rif resistance +ve$ Rif resistance -ve FL-LPA SL - LPA FQ and/or SLI Resistance

H Resistant (inhA and/or KatG mutation)
Eto resistance (inhA mutation)

$RR detected in new case with no risk factors for DRTB needs retesting if only MTB detected is very low as it makes Rif resistance detection less reliable
*SLLPA may be done directly if smear +ve else send for MGIT followed by SLLPA or LC DST (Mfx 2.0, Km, Cm, Lzd)
"LPA may be done directly if smear +ve else send for MGIT followed by FLPA to evaluate for H (inhA and/or KatG mutn) and Eto (inhA) resistance

## TYPE OF PATIENTS
Microbiologically confirmed RS Pulmonary TB

### TB TREATMENT REGIMENS
2HRZE + 4HRE

| WEIGHT BAND | Intensive phase HRZ 50/75/15 100 | E 50/75 | Continuation phase HR 50/75 | E 100 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 4-7 kg | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 8-11 kg | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 12-15 kg | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| 16-24 kg | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| 25-29 kg | 3 + 1A* | 3 | 3 + 1A* | 3 |
| 30-39 kg | 2 + 2A* | 2 | 2 + 2A* | 2 |

*A=Adult FDC (HRZE = 75/150/400/275; HRE = 75/150/275)

**ISONIAZID (H)** 7-15 mg/kg (maximum dose 300mg/day)
**RIFAMPICIN (R)** 10-20 mg/kg (maximum dose 600mg/day)
**PYRAZINAMIDE (Z)** 30-40 mg/kg (maximum 2000mg/day)
**ETHAMBUTOL (E)** 15-25 mg/kg (maximum 1500mg/day)

### Consider steroids in miliary TB with hypoxia, Endobronchial TB massive bilateral effusion with distress
*   Prednisone dose 2 mg/kg daily or Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks
*   Reduce dose gradually over next 4 weeks before stopping
*   Pyridoxine 10 mg/day for 6 months
*   Nutritional support
*   Treat co-morbid conditions: HIV, SAM

*DR TB algorithm-DST

## MONITORING
*   When to assess
    *   Within 2 weeks of starting therapy for checking that- correct dose, combination of drugs is being taken, adherence and tolerance to drugs
    *   Then every month till completion of treatment
*   What to assess
    *   Appropriateness of therapy:
        *   Correct combination, acceptance/tolerance
        *   Counsel about need to complete & not miss on doses (Inform, if doses are missed)
    *   Response to therapy:
        *   Clinical (symptoms, adverse effects, weight, dose revision)
        *   X-ray at end of therapy
        *   Do X-ray for worsening at any time OR slow resolution OR persistent symptoms at end of IP
        *   NAAT is not appropriate follow up tool for monitoring progress of disease
    *   Smear examination at end of treatment (to declare outcome)
        *   Repeat microbiological test (smear, MGIT, NAAT) at end of IP & at end of therapy, if still symptomatic or any deterioration/failure to respond
    *   After treatment completion: follow up patients clinically at end of 6, 12, 18 & 24 months

## MANAGING TREATMENT INTERRUPTIONS (NON-ADHERENCE)

| Interruption up to 4 weeks | Interruption over 4 weeks |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Resume therapy (Restart if missed within 1st 4 weeks) | Reinvestigate for DRTB |
| Rif resistance not detected | Rif resistance detected |
| Retreat with 1st line drugs and Check for INH resistance and treat | Treat as MDRTB |

*   In case interruption happens in CP & on retrieval, the patient has no clinical evidence of active disease & tests for DRTB are negative, the remaining treatment course to be completed
*   Resons for interruption should always be evaluated & addressed in all cases (Address myths/fear or any intolerance)
