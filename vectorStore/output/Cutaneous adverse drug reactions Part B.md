# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
CUTANEOUS ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS- PART B

ICD-10-L27.0

Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR) are undesirable clinical manifestations to a drug, which include predictable or
unanticipated side effects, with or without systemic involvement.

## COMMON TYPES OF CADR

| NON- SEVERE CADR | SEVERE CADR |
|---|---|
| Fixed drug eruption | Drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome/ DRESS | Angioedema/ Anaphylaxis\* |
| Maculopapular/ Exanthematous (FDE)\* reactions\* | Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis | Erythema multiforme/ Stevens Johnson syndrome/ Toxic epidermal necrolysis |

\*Refer to separate STW on Urticaria/ Angioedema, and cADR Part-A for FDE/ Maculopapular/ Exanthematous reactions

## DRUG RASH WITH EOSINOPHILIA AND SYSTEMIC SYMPTOMS (DRESS) SYNDROME
*   Potentially life threatening systemic adverse reaction
*   Onset 2-6 weeks after start of drug intake (up to 12 weeks)
*   The rash may continue to progress weeks to months after
    discontinuation of the drug
*   Commonly observed with anticonvulsants, **dapsone**,
    **allopurinol**, **abacavir**, **leflunomide**, **minocycline**

### When to suspect DRESS syndrome
*   Exposure to a high risk drug
*   Clinical presentation: fever (>38°C-40°C), rash, leukocytosis with eosinophilia,
    lymphadenopathy, hepato-renal dysfunction
*   Features of the rash: involves >50% body surface area, facial edema,
    desquamation or dusky erythema
*   Occasionally pustules and targetoid lesions may be seen

## MANAGEMENT

| PRIMARY CARE | SECONDARY CARE | TERTIARY CARE |
|---|---|---|
| Withdraw drugs  Assess vitals, stabilise the patient and refer to higher center  Symptomatic relief:  Antihistamines, emollients  Do not add any unnecessary new medications | Same as primary care  CBC, absolute eosinophil count (optional), LFT, renal function- monitored at least weekly  CXR, ECG and ECHO to rule out myocarditis  Treatment  If no evidence of major organ involvement  First line- Systemic steroids- Prednisolone 0.5-2 mg/kg, slow taper after symptoms and signs resolve (over months if needed)  Antihistamines-Pheniramine 25 mg TID, bland emollients like liquid paraffin  If there is severe organ involvement- liver, renal or cardiac refer to tertiary center for multidisciplinary intensive care | Same as primary/secondary care Second line - Cyclosporine (if the renal function is normal)  Management will require a multidisciplinary team approach, depending on the organ(s) involved  In the presence of severe liver failure, hemophagocytic syndrome, gastrointestinal bleeding, multiorgan failure, the patient may require intensive care treatment |

## STEVENS JOHNSON SYNDROME (SJS) AND TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS (TEN)
*   Acute, severe mucocutaneous reactions associated with epidermal
    detachment and/or tenderness, and widespread erythematous
    lesions with central dusky erythema or vesiculation often
    associated with high grade fever
*   Usually observed with aromatic anticonvulsants, **allopurinol**,
    **nevirapine**, **abacavir**, **NSAIDs**, **co-trimoxazole**
*   The classification of SJS, TEN is based on the extent of detachment
*   D/d-Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, pemphigus

| TYPE | DETACHMENT (% BSA) | WIDESPREAD ATYPICAL TARGETS \*OR ERYTHEMATOUS MACULES |
|---|---|---|
| SJS | <10% | Present |
| SJS-TEN | 10-30% | Present |
| TEN | ≥30% | Present |
| TEN without SPOTS | ≥10% | Absent |

\*Atypical targets (Red macules with purpuric
vesiculations/crusted centers)

## PROGNOSIS

Assess prognosis with a SCORTEN score done within 24 hours
of presentation and repeated 3 days later

| SCORTEN PROGNOSTIC FACTORS | POINTS |
|---|---|
| Age > 40 years | 1 |
| Tachycardia > 120 bpm | 1 |
| Neoplasia | 1 |
| Initial detachment > 10% | 1 |
| Serum urea > 60 mg/dL | 1 |
| Serum bicarbonate < 20mmol/L | 1 |
| Blood glucose > 252mg/dL | 1 |

| SCORTEN SCORE | ESTIMATED MORTALITY % |
|---|---|
| 0-1 | 3 |
| 2 | 12 |
| 3 | 35 |
| 4 | 58 |
| ≥ 5 | > 90 |

## INVESTIGATIONS
*   Chest X-ray
*   ECG
*   Laboratory tests- CBC, LFT, KFT, electrolytes, magnesium,
    phosphate, lactate
*   Blood gas analysis
*   Microbiology- Pus culture from infected areas and blood culture
*   Skin biopsy- Not usually required unless the diagnosis is in doubt
*   Optional- In TEN, biopsy and direct immunofluorescence is useful to
    rule out SLE and pemphigus

## MANAGEMENT

| PRIMARY CARE | SECONDARY CARE | TERTIARY CARE |
|---|---|---|
| See primary care for drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) | Assess vitals, stabilise the patient, nutrition and fluid replacement as appropriate  Local care for skin and mucosae  Skin care- dilute potassium permanganate baths/ saline compresses/Chlorhexidine baths  Detached epidermis can be left in situ and covered with non-adherent dressing (sterile vaseline gauze)  ► Topical antibiotics (Mupirocin or Fucidin) on sloughed off areas  Oral care- Rinse mouth with Chlorhexidine 2-3 times, soft paraffin on lips as needed, steroid mouth washes  Eye care- refer to ophthalmologist  Antibiotics-broad spectrum antibiotics (in case of sepsis or secondary infection) to cover staph, strep and pseudomonas. Change according to culture results and avoid suspected drug class  Adjuvant systemic therapy (ideally within the first 24-72 hours of onset)  The role of systemic steroids is limited to early phase of SJS/TEN. High doses for longer periods can increase the risk of sepsis and metabolic complications. However judicious use of Prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg or equivalent dose of intravenous Dexamethasone for 3-7 days may be of benefit  ► Cyclosporine in a dose of 3-5 mg/kg for a period of 10-14 days (with monitoring)  If skin detachment >10% refer to a center with an ICU familiar with management of skin failure  If < 10% follow the treatment as described | Admit in specialized units within dermatology wards if vitals are stable and follow secondary care treatment  Barrier nursing  If patient has SIRS/ sepsis or in shock, admit to ICU  Long term follow up will be required to address complications: ophthalmic, skin and respiratory tract involvement |

ANY DRUG BELONGING TO ANY MEDICINAL SYSTEM CAN CAUSE CADR
