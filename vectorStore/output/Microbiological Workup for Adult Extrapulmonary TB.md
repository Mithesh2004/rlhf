# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) of
MICROBIOLOGICAL WORK-UP FOR ADULT EXTRAPULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS

## LOGISTICS INVOLVED IN SAMPLE COLLECTION AND TRANSPORTATION
*   Collect Samples for Microbiological work-up in sterile containers before treatment is started. (Mention date & time of collection)
*   Specimens to be sent in sterile saline (NOT in formalin)
*   Establish linkages between peripheral centres, District centres and Tertiary centre/medical colleges/IRL. Specify details of person to be contacted, department and contact number during referrals
*   Transportation at 2-8 °C
*   Maximum time for transportation in cold chain should be 5 days from time of collection
*   Quantity of sample mentioned is only for microbiological work-up. Tests like histopathology, cytology, ADA, glucose, protein, etc will require additional sample
*   Microbiological tests for TB (smear, molecular tests, culture) will be performed as per availability and preparedness of site
*   PHC and CHC should perform smear microscopy and molecular diagnostic tests. If sample less than 500 µl, refer directly to Tertiary centre/medical colleges/IRL for culture. Residual sample in the needle and syringe used to collect the specimen can be used for smear
*   MGIT to be used for culture. However, if MGIT is not available, LJ medium should be used

## REJECTION OF SAMPLES
*   Unlabelled samples (All specimens MUST be labelled & have a unique patient identifier)
*   Have no collection date indicated
*   Insufficient quantity - No specimen in container
*   Damaged - Specimen leaked or broken in transit
*   Samples greater than 3 days old at room temperature and more than 5 days in refrigeration are unreliable specimens for testing

Precious samples should be transported to IRL.

Diagnostic algorithm of NTEP to be followed in the Microbiology labs

## MICROBIOLOGICAL GUIDANCE FOR COMMON TYPES OF EXTRAPULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS

### OSTEOARTICULAR/ MUSCULOSKELETAL
*   Sample: Tissue, pus, synovial fluid
*   Sample amount: Biopsy: Specimen material 1 cm x 1 cm biopsies. Any caseous area should be sampled. Add 0.5-2 ml sterile saline to biopsy depending on its size to avoid drying of tissue specimen
*   Optimum fluid/pus: 2-3ml.
*   Swabs are sub-optimal samples

### PLEURAL
*   Sample: Pleural fluid
*   Sample amount: 10-15 ml

### MENINGITIS
*   Sample: CSF:
*   Sample amount: 3-5 ml

### LYMPHADENITIS
*   Sample: FNA/Biopsy
*   Sample amount: Specimen material 1 cm x 1 cm biopsy. Add 0.5-2 ml sterile saline to biopsy depending on its size to avoid drying of tissue specimen
*   Optimum FNA sample: 2 ml

### UROGENITAL
*   Sample: urine
*   Sample amount: Entire early morning urine sample (3-5 days)

### FEMALE GENITAL
*   Sample: Endometrial curettage/biopsy
*   Sample amount: Biopsy: Specimen material 1cm x 1 cm biopsies. Any caseous area should be sampled. Add 0.5-2 ml sterile saline to biopsy depending on its size to avoid drying of tissue specimen

### GASTROINTESTINAL
*   Sample: Tissue, pus, peritoneal fluid
*   Sample amount: Biopsy: Specimen material 1 cm X 1cm biopsy (Atleast 6 biopsies for microbiological diagnosis including any caseous area). Any caseous area should be sampled. Add 0.5-2 ml sterile saline to biopsy depending on its size to avoid drying of tissue specimen
*   Optimum fluid/pus: 5-10ml

    attempt molecular testing
    at that site}
    B --> C{If biopsy is not possible or at
    an inaccessible site, refer
    patient to the next higher
    centre immediately where
    appropriate test can be
    done}

    centre is inadequate, send
    directly to nearest Tertiary
    centre/medical colleges/IRL}

Microbiological procedures:
*   AFB Smear Microscopy except in GI TB
*   NAAT
*   Culture (MGIT. If MGIT is not available LJ medium should be used)
*   Drug susceptibility testing, if culture is positive

## ABBREVIATIONS
ADA: Adenosine Deaminase
AFB: Acid fast bacilli
FNA: Fine needle aspirate
LJ medium: Lowenstein Jensen medium
CHC: Community Health Centre MGIT: Mycobacteria Growth Indicator tube (Liquid culture medium for mycobacteria) IRL: Intermediate Reference laboratory
NAAT: Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests-Xpert MTB/RIF/TrueNat
