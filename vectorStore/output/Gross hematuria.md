# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**GROSS HAEMATURIA**
ICD-10-R31.0

**PERFORM THOROUGH CLINICAL EVALUATION**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[SYMPTOMS] --> B("Blood in urine - red coloured or dark coloured
    May be associated with pain:
        - Pain during voiding (urethra)
        - Pain in suprapubic region (bladder)
        - Pain in flank (kidney)
    Acute retention of urine due to clots
    Haematuria associated with clots (severe)");
```

**EXAMINATION**
* Pulse, blood pressure
* Check for pallor
* Check for anasarca
* Per abdomen
  examination: Palpable
  bladder, flank mass
* Digital rectal
  examination: Enlarged
  prostate, hard nodular/
  smooth surfaced
  prostate
* Rule out vaginal causes
  of bleeding

**RED URINE BUT NOT HAEMATURIA**
* Foods: beetroot,
  blackberry,
  rhubarb
* Medicines:
  rifampicin,
  pyridium

Even single episode of
haematuria warrants
complete evaluation

## MAKE A CLINICAL
**DIAGNOSIS: IS HAEMATURIA**

### INITIAL
* Urethra: stone, **urethritis**, **stricture**
* Prostate: inflammation, benign
  hyperplasia, **malignancy**

### TOTAL
* Kidney: stone, **malignancy** (renal parenchyma,
  pelvis/ureter, genito-urinary **tuberculosis**)
* Ureter: stone, **malignancy**, genito- urinary
  **tuberculosis**
* Bladder: infection, genitourinary **tuberculosis**,
  stone, **malignancy**)

### TERMINAL
* Bladder: stone, tumor at bladder neck
* Prostate: inflammation, benign
  hyperplasia, **malignancy**

## HOW TO INVESTIGATE

### ESSENTIAL
* Urine examination - routine, microscopy
* Hemoglobin estimation
* Kidney function tests (KFT)
* Ultrasonography of kidney urinary
  bladder and prostate region

### DESIRABLE
* Contrast enhanced computed
  tomography of kidney urinary bladder
  region/intravenous pyelography (if KFT
  normal)
* Magnetic resonance imaging of Kidney
  urinary bladder region (if KFT deranged)
* Urine cytology if > 40yrs or smoker
* Cystoscopy if > 40 years or smoker

### OPTIONAL
* Urine culture
* Urine for active
  sediments(if
  nephrotic/
  nephritic
  syndrome
  suspected)
* PT/INR (if
  bleeding disorder
  suspected)
* Serum prostate
  specific antigen
  (if required)
* Urine for acid fast
  bacilli - 3 samples
  (if tuberculosis
  suspected)

### WHEN TO REFER
**(WARNING SIGNS)**
* Deranged kidney functions
* Suspecting malignancy
* Haematuria with hypertension/
  albuminuria
* Persistent severe haematuria

## HOW TO TREAT

### GENERAL
* Start intravenous fluids
  if required (primary
  level)
* If Anaemia - may trans-
  fuse blood as required
  (primary level)
* Manage clot colic /
  flank pain with analge-
  sics (primary level)
* If Acute urinary reten-
  tion - catheterise with
  20/22Fr 3 way Foley and
  may start continuous
  irrigation with normal
  saline (Primary level)
* Cystoscopic clot evacu-
  ation may be per-
  formed if feasible (ter-
  tiary level)
* If basic evaluation and
  management facilities
  are unavailable - refer
  (tertiary level)

### SPECIFIC
* Haematuria should be considered as a symptom of genitourinary malignancy in patients >40years old until
  proven otherwise
* Suspected nephrotic/nephritic syndrome: cola coloured urine, proteinuria, anasarca, hypertension - Refer to
  nephrologist (tertiary level)
* Suspect urinary tract infection: presents with dysuria, increased frequency of voiding and other irritative lower
  urinary tract symptoms with/without fever- treat with broad spectrum oral antibiotics (primary level)
