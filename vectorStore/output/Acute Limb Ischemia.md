# Standard Treatment Workflow
**ACUTE LIMB ISCHEMIA**
ICD-10-M62.262

## WHAT IS **ACUTE LIMB ISCHEMIA**?
A sudden decrease
in limb perfusion
that threatens limb
viability and requires
urgent evaluation
and management

## SYMPTOMS
*   Pain at rest, paresthesia,
    muscle weakness/paralysis
    of the affected limb

## SIGNS
*   Absence of pulses distal to
    the occlusion, cool and pale
    or mottled skin, reduced
    sensation and decreased
    strength

## REMEMBER THE FIVE P'S:
**Pain**, **Pallor**, **Pulselessness**,
**Paresthesia**, and **Paralysis***
*The last two may or may
not be present depending
upon extent and duration
of vascular occlusion. In
advanced cases, there may
be frank gangrene

## COMMON CAUSES OF LIMB ISCHEMIA
### NON-TRAUMATIC
*   **EMBOLIC**:
    Embolism from the heart or
    atherosclerotic aorta. Embolus may
    arise from heart in case of atrial
    fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction,
    mitral stenosis, left ventricular
    dysfunction, left atrial myxoma,
    prosthetic heart valves or endocarditis

### TRAUMATIC
*   **BLUNT INJURY**:
    Traction injury or contusion
*   **Sharp or penetrating
    injury**

## EVALUATION

### HISTORY
*   Duration of symptoms
*   H/o intermittent claudication
*   H/o cardiac disorder (palpitations, chest pain, shortness of
    breath, loss of consciousness)
*   H/o Diabetes, Hypertension, Smoking, Drugs (OCPs, HRT)
*   Long standing fever
*   H/o trauma/surgical or endovascular interventions

### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
*   Blood Pressure
*   All peripheral pulses
*   Condition of the limb: temperature, colour, hair loss, nail
    bed capillary filling, sensation and motor power,
    gangrene/pre-gangrene
*   Cardiac Murmurs
*   Wound Inspection
*   Bone injury/Nerve injury in case of traumatic ischemia

### DUPLEX ULTRASOUND/DOPPLER FOR ARTERIES AND VEINS
Doppler examination is helpful in evaluation of flow in the
arteries and veins and condition of arterial wall

### EMBOLISM VS THROMBOSIS
*   History suggestive of cardiac
    disorder (palpitations, chest pain,
    shortness of breath, loss of
    consciousness) predicts acute
    embolism whereas a history of
    previous claudication suggests
    acute thrombosis in a
    pre-existing atherosclerotic lesion
*   Doppler evaluation can
    differentiate between hypoechoic
    thrombus in otherwise normal
    and distended blood vessel
    (suggestive of acute embolism)
    and heterogeneous echogenic
    plaque with multiple areas of
    calcification (thrombosis in artery
    with atherosclerotic plaque)

## STAGES OF **ACUTE LIMB ISCHEMIA**

| STAGE | DESCRIPTION AND PROGNOSIS                                      | SENSORY LOSS     | MUSCLE WEAKNESS   | ARTERIAL DOPPLER | VENOUS DOPPLER |
| :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------- | :--------------- | :------------- |
| Ila   | Limb marginally threatened, salvageable if promptly treated      | None             | None              | Audible          | Audible        |
| Ilb   | Limb immediately threatened, salvageable with immediate revascularization | Minimal (toes) or none | None              | Audible          | Audible        |
| III   | Limb irreversibly damaged, major tissue loss or permanent nerve damage inevitable | More than toes, associated with rest pain | Mild or moderate | Usually inaudible | Audible        |
|       |                                                                | Profound, anaesthetic | Profound, paralysis (rigor) | Inaudible        | Inaudible        |

## MANAGEMENT OF TRAUMATIC **ACUTE LIMB ISCHEMIA**
### A. SHARP/PENETRATING INJURY
i. Control bleeding by applying pressure bandage over the wound
ii. Resuscitation
iii. Vascular repair (Stage I, Ila, Ilb ischemia), Amputation (Stage III ischemia)
iv. Concomitant bone/nerve injury should be managed simultaneously
v. Supportive treatment, pain relief/antibiotic prophylaxis/tetanus
prophylaxis

### B. BLUNT INJURY: TRACTION INJURY OR CONTUSION
i. Vascular repair (Stage I, lla, Ilb ischemia),
Amputation (Stage III ischemia)
ii. Concomitant bone/nerve injury should be
managed simultaneously
iii. Supportive treatment, pain relief/antibiotic
prophylaxis

## MANAGEMENT OF NON-TRAUMATIC **ACUTE LIMB ISCHEMIA**
Injection Heparin 100 units/Kg Intravenous
