# Standard Treatment Workflow
SUSPECTED BRAIN TUMORS
ICD-C71, D33

July/2024
Brain tumors are seen with equal
frequency in males and females

## DEMOGRAPHICS
Astrocytoma is the commonest brain tumor
in children followed by embryonal tumor

Meningioma is the commonest
tumor in adults followed by glioma

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF BRAIN TUMORS

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[SYMPTOMS] --> B(Recent onset headache, with or without vomiting);
    A --> C(Seizures);
    A --> D(Focal deficit like monoparesis, hemiparesis);
```

*   Recent onset
headache, with or
without vomiting

*   Seizures

*   Focal deficit like
monoparesis,
hemiparesis

*   Gradual vision
loss (unilateral/
bilateral)

*   Cranial nerve
deficits (eg. hearing
loss)

*   Increasing head-size
(children with open
fontanalle)

**HIGH INDEX OF SUSPICION FOR BRAIN TUMOR WHEN
PATIENT HAS:**

*   Adult onset seizures
*   Progressive symptoms
*   Focal neurological deficits
*   Severe headache
*   Recurrent vomitings
*   Blurring of vision
*   Drowsy or altered sensorium
*   Recurrent seizures
*   Pupillary asymmetry - **Anisocoria**
*   Abnormal posturing
*   Respiratory distress, abnormal breathing patterns
*   Bradycardia and hypertension

**IF RED FLAG SIGNS PRESENT**

*   Give Inj **Dexa 4mg** IV
*   Loading dose of antiepileptic to prevent seizure
*   200ml (to adult patients or as per weight to children) 20% mannitol IV over 30 minutes (only if
systolic BP > 90 mmHg) and refer to higher centre immediately after stabilisation of ABC

    B --> E{Positive};
    E --> F(• Phenytoinization (if seizures are present), Airway protection (If patient has altered sensorium));
