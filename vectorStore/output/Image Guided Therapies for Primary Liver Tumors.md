## IMAGE GUIDED THERAPIES
### FOR PRIMARY LIVER TUMORS
ICD-10-C22.8

**PRIMARY LIVER TUMORS**

Primary liver tumors majorly consists of **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**, **Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC)** and **combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC)**
HCC being is the most common
There are no specific signs or symptoms for primary liver tumors
Radiological and lab investigations are the main tool for the diagnosis
In patients with underlying cirrhosis new onset of ascites, jaundice and/or variceal haemorrhage should prompt investigations to look for **HCC**
Patients with pre-existing cirrhosis; are at high risk of developing **HCC** and should be under surveillance for development

Risk Factors
*   Hepatitis B (33%)
*   Alcoholic liver disease (30%)
*   Hepatitis C (21%)
*   NASH
*   Other causes of cirrhosis
Serum Alpha fetoprotein: elevated AFP value should prompt imaging work up

**INVESTIGATIONS**

**Essential**
Lab investigations
*   Liver function tests
*   Kidney function tests
*   CBC
*   PT/INR
*   Alpha feto-protein (AFP)

Imaging
*   Recent contrast enhanced multiphasic CT/MRI

**Desirable**
*   PIVKA II

**Optional**
*   FDG PET CECT

**ABLATIVE THERAPIES**
*Chemical ablation*
*   Ethanol
*   Acetic acid

*Thermal ablation*
*   **Radiofrequency Ablation**
*   **Microwave ablation**
*   **Cryoablation**

*Non chemical-non thermal ablation*
*   **Irreversible electroporation**

*IMAGE GUIDANCE*
*   USG (contrast optional)
*   CT (contrast optional)
*   Both CT & USG

*Early HCC*
*   RFA/MWA of HCC
*Multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT/MRI*

**DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP**

*   **LI-RADS** classification system should be used for diagnosis
*   Multiphasic CT/MRI or contrast enhanced ultrasound is needed for diagnosis
*   In patients at risk, if a lesion of size > 2cm with arterial phase hyperenhancement and washout on subsequent phase is diagnostic of **HCC**
*   Biopsy is needed if
    *   Equivocal imaging findings
    *   Non-cirrhotic liver

**PATIENT MANAGEMENT**

Tumor characterization staging and presence of extrahepatic disease
IR therapies based on size and number of lesions
*   < 3 lesions of < 3 cm: consider ablation
*   Lesion > 3cm & < 5cm may consider combination of **TACE** & Ablation
*   Lesion > 5 & < 8 cm consider **TACE**
*   Lesion > 8 cm consider **TARE**

Portal vein status:
*   Portal vein tumoral thrombus: consider **TARE/SBRT**,
    **TACE** may be considered for segmental/sub-segmental branch tumoral thrombus

Location of the tumor:
*   Tumors at critical location like Perivascular/pericholedochal/exhophytic/subdiaphragmatic lesion
    *   Consider **TACE**
    *   Combination of **TACE** & ablation / **MWA** in experienced centres

Performance status (ECOG) ref PS 0, 1 suitable for IR therapies, PS 2 may consider **TARE**
Liver function tests: Serum bilirubin >3 mg/dl & AST > five times the upper limit of normal contraindication for **TACE**
Child-Pugh class: IR therapies should be considered for Child-Pugh classref < B8

**THERMAL ABLATION: INDICATIONS**

*   Very early (single lesion <2 cm) and early **HCC** single lesion or upto three lesions each less than 3cm
*   Ablation may be considered for all primary liver lesions amenable for ablation in following situation
    *   Bridging therapy for liver transplantation
    *   Residual and recurrent **HCC**
    *   Combination therapy with **TACE**
    *   Repeat ablation should be considered for focal residual lesion < 3 cm along the periphery or within the ablation zone

Lesion with APHE
Lesion with Venous washout
Ablation being performed

**CONTRAINDICATION**
*   Ascites
*   Sepsis and uncorrectable coagulopathy
*   Intrahepatic biliary dilatation
*   Intravascular invasion or extrahepatic metastatic disease
*   Arrhythmias (for IRE)
*   Poor PS (>2)
*   Severely deranged liver function (CTP class C)

**POST PROCEDURE COMPLICATIONS**

*   **Immediate post procedure:**
    *   Bleed/hemoperitoneum
    *   Post procedure appearance of perihepatic hematoma/fluid/ascites suggestive of bleed/hemoperitoneum
    *   If continuous increase in size/volume of hematoma/fluid plan CT angiogram to localize bleeding vessels
    *   If active contrast extravasation noted on CT angiogram plan urgent angio-embolization of the bleeding vessel

*   Post embolization syndrome: Fever may persist for 2-3 days and pain may persist for 5-7 days
    *   Severe/excruciating pain at any point of time should be evaluated with USG and if needed CECT to look for the cause
*   Visceral/diaphragmatic/lung/GB injury: Rare complications but may be looked for if severe/excruciating pain persists

**TRANSARTERIAL CHEMOEMBOLIZATION (TACE)**

**TACE**: Intra-arterial infusion of cytotoxic agent followed by embolisation of the tumor-feeding blood vessels

TACE performed in 2 ways
*   **cTACE**: Emulsion of Lipiodol & chemotherapeutic agent is injected into the arteries supplying the tumor
*   **DEB TACE**: Chemotherapy loaded microspheres are selectively injected into the arteries supplying the tumor

The use of drug-eluting beads has shown similar benefit to conventional **TACE** (**cTACE**; gelfoam-Lipiodol particles) and either of the two can be utilized
**TACE** is suitable for patients with well-defined nodules and preserved portal flow
**TACE** should be performed in a super-selective manner and avoid all possible non-target embolization

3m FU: No APHE

**TACE INDICATIONS**
*   Multinodular or single nodule HCC of size > 5 cm with preserved portal flow, preserved liver function and PS=0 (**INASL-BCLC/BCLC-2022 stage B**)
*   In small **HCC** where ablation is not possible

**TACE CONTRAINDICATIONS**
*   Decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B ≥8, including jaundice with Serum Bilirubin > 3.0 mg/dl, hepatic encephalopathy, refractory ascites and hepatorenal syndrome)
*   Portal vein tumoral thrombus
*   Extensive tumor involving both liver lobes
*   Untreatable arteriovenous fistula
*   Renal insufficiency, including creatinine ≥2 mg/dL or creatinine clearance <30 mL/min

**POST TACE COMPLICATIONS**

*   Arterial injury/dissection (small vessel and minor injury may be left as it is and major vessel injury may require measures like angioplasty and/or stenting)
*   Tumor rupture (Rare) presents as hemoperitoneum/ascites/hemodynamic shock and may be seen in few hours to 24 hours post **TACE**

*   Post embolization syndrome: Pain, fever, Nausea/Vomiting - these symptoms are mostly self limiting resolves in 2-3 days and needs symptomatic care (Paracetamol and/or antiemetics)

If there is deterioration on clinical condition of the patient after **TACE** (3-7 days) with severe post embolization syndrome then lab investigations (LFT, KFT, CBC and PT/INR) and USG should be done to look for post **TACE** liver failure

*   Post TACE Liver failure
    *   > 10 times elevation of baseline AST/ALT
    *   > 3 times elevation of baseline serum Bilirubin
    *   Post procedure hepatic encephalopathy
    *   INR elevation > 2.5 of baseline
