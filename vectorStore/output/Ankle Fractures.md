# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
# ANKLE FRACTURES 
ICD-10-S82 
Department of Health Research
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India

## ABBREVIATIONS
AP: Antero-posterior ICU: Intensive Care Unit PM: Posterior Malleolus SAD: Supination Addiction
ATLS: Advanced Trauma Life Support LM: Lateral malleolus ROM: Range of Motion TENS: Titanium Elastic Nail System 
HDU: High Dependency Unit MM: Medial Malleolar RTA: Road Traffic Accident 

## DEFINITION
Classically called the 
‘**Malleolar fractures**’, these 
are fractures of distal 
tibia/fibula or both 

## MECHANISM OF INJURY
*   High-energy trauma in 
young patients (RTA)
*   Low-energy twisting 
injuries in elderly

## INVESTIGATIONS

## CLASSIFICATION

## MANAGEMENT

## REFERENCES
*   A. Airway and cervical spine 
*   B. Breathing and ventilation
*   C. Circulation and 
haemmorhage control
*   D. Disability and neurological 
status
*   E. Exposure and environment 
control

**Open fracture STW**
*   Fasciotomy and external 
fixator application
*   Urgent reduction and 
immobilization

Management of patient as per ATLS protocols
Presentation:
*   Pain, swelling, deformity at the ankle

### PHYSICAL EXAM
**Inspect**
▪ Look circumferentially to rule-out an open fracture
**Palpate**
▪ Tenderness at the ankle
▪ Rule out **compartment syndrome** when pain + on 
passive stretching of toes
**Assess**
▪ Any differences in pulse examination between 
extremities – Suspected **vascular injury**
▪ Inability to move toes actively – Suspected 
**Tendon injury/nerve injury**
▪ Dislocated ankle

### RADIOGRAPHS
*   AP View (up to knee joint to look for high fibula fractures)
*   Lateral View 
*   Mortise view
*   Stress views - Weight-bearing and external rotation 
stress views in suspected **syndesmotic injuries** 

### CT SCAN (DESIRABLE)
*   Detailed assessment of fracture patho-anatomy
◦ To look for suspected **posterior malleolar fracture**
◦ To look for impaction 
*   Preoperative planning for operative approaches and fixation techniques

### WEBERS CLASSIFICATION
[Image of Webers Classification]

### LAUGE HANSEN CLASSIFICATION
4 main fracture types based on mechanism of injury
[Image of Lauge Hansen Classification]

### GOALS OF TREATMENT
Restoration of joint stability 
*   Anatomical reduction of the 
articular surface
*   Maintenance of ankle joint and 
medial clear space
*   Assess and manage the 
**syndesmotic joint**

### IMPLANT OPTIONS
Choice of implant is related to
▪ Fracture pattern
▪ Degree of displacement
▪ Familiarity of surgeon
**Fibula (Lateral malleolus)**
▪ Anti-glide plating
▪ Anatomical locking plates
▪ Screw/K-wire/TENS
**Medial Malleolus**
▪ Screws – ensure proximity to 
strong bone tibia plafond
▪ Tension band wiring
▪ Anti-glide plating (SAD injury)
**Posterior malleolus**
▪ Cancellous cannulated screws
▪ Buttress plating
**Syndesmosis**
▪ Screws
▪ Tightrope
**Ankle spanning Ex-fix** – for 
temporary splintage
**Open fractures**
Waiting for soft tissues to 
settle until definitive surgery

#### At primary centre
*   Active bleed
*   Suspected **compartment syndrome**
*   Open fracture
*   Simple fracture

#### At secondary centre
*   Stop the bleed 
*   Debride for open fracture
*   Fasciotomy if warranted for impending 
**compartment syndrome**
*   External fixator application
*   CT scan for detailed assessment

#### Refer to tertiary centre
*   If final fixation not possible
*   Complex fracture dislocation
*   Vascular repair warranted
*   Multi-system injury
*   Tendon injury

#### At primary centre
*   B/K Slab/Cast for stable 
syndesmotic/infrasyndesmotic injuries
*   Open reduction internal fixation for 
simple fractures

#### At secondary centre
Refer to tertiary centre
*   HDU/ICU management for 
multi-system injury
*   Fasciotomy if required
*   Vascular repair
*   Final fixation once swelling subsides/ 
blisters resolve/patient physiologically fit
