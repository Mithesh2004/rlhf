# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## LUNG CANCER
ICD-10-C34.90

Evaluation and management by multidisciplinary team (MDT) of oncology experts

WHEN TO
SUSPECT
## PRESENTATION
*   Cough
*   Chest pain
*   Hemoptysis
*   Hoarseness
*   Breathlessness
*   Non resolving pneumonia
*   Mass lesion
*   Symptoms persist even
after treating pneumonia
## IMPORTANT ASSESSMENT PARAMETERS
*   Pulmonary function
*   Clinical examination:
    *   Age and
    *   comorbidities
*   Performance
status
*   Palpable lymph nodes
*   Chest wall tenderness
*   Skeletal tenderness
*   Pleural effusion
## INITIAL EVALUATION
*   CXR
*   Sputum cytology
*   Pulmonary reserve:
    *   Effort tolerance
    *   Walk test
*   Pulmonary function tests (PFT)

## LIMITED DISEASE
*   CECT thorax and upper abdomen
*   Obtain tissue for diagnosis
    *   percutaneously by image guidance or
    *   by bronchoscopy
## DIAGNOSTIC
CONFIRMATON
## ADVANCED DISEASE
*   Pleural fluid cytology
*   Pleural biopsy (image guidance if available)
*   Cervical lymph node aspiration cytology/biopsy

**All lung shadows are not tuberculosis ! Obtain diagnostic investigations before starting empirical ATT !**

## PATHOLOGY ASSESSMENT
Biopsy/ cell block/smear
*   **Histopathology**
    *   adenocarcinoma, squamous
    *   carcinoma, poorly differentiated
    *   carcinoma, small cell carcinoma
*   **Immunohistochemistry**
    *   TTF 1, p40, synaptophysin/
    *   chromogranin
*   Preserve tissue for molecular
    analysis
*   Molecular tests for
    adenocarcinoma: EGFR, ALK,
    ROS-1

## SMALL CELL LUNG CARCINOMA
Do CECT thorax and abdomen
*   Non metastatic disease T1-4, N0-3, MO
    *   Metastatic work up: PET CT &
    MRI brain
    *   Consider surgery for T1-2, No
    *   Concurrent CT + RT
*   Metastatic disease Any T, any N, M1
    *   Prophylactic cranial irradiation
    *   Symptomatic & supportive care
    *   Palliative chemotherapy
    *   carboplatin + etoposide

## NON SMALL CELL LUNG CARCINOMA
Do CECT thorax and abdomen
*   Non metastatic disease: TI-4, No-3
    *   Metastatic work up: PET CT and MRI brain
*   Metastatic disease: Any T, any N, M1
    *   Symptomatic & supportive care
    *   Refer to oncology centre
    *   Palliative chemotherapy (platinum doublet
    in fit patients, single agent chemotherapy
    for PS 2)
    *   Oral TKI if target mutation detected
    *   Immunotherapy may be an option in
    some patients

### AVAILABLE TREATMENT OPTIONS
*   Chemotherapy doublet:
    *   Carboplatin or cisplatin with pemetrexed or paclitaxel or gemcitabine or
    etoposide
