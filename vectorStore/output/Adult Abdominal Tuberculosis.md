# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**ADULT ABDOMINAL TUBERCULOSIS**
ICD-10-A18.3

WHEN TO SUSPECT
Any organ in abdominal cavity, including gut lumen & peritoneum may be affected

| PERITONEAL | INTESTINAL | ESOPHAGEAL | GASTRO-DUODENAL | PERIANAL | PANCREATIC | HEPATO-BILIARY |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| • Abdominal distension  • Pain abdomen  • Fever | • Recurrent intestinal colic  • Partial/incomplete intestinal obstruction  • Chronic diarrhoea  • Weight loss  • Palpable mass abdomen  • Lower gastrointestinal bleeding | • Dysphagia  • Odynophagia  • Hematemesis  • Constitutional symptoms | • Gastric outlet obstruction  • Gastrointestinal bleed | • Simple/ Complex peri-anal fistula  • Persistent discharge  • Fistulae which recur after multiple surgeries | • Abdominal pain  • Obstructive jaundice  • Dilated pancreatic or bile duct with (peri)-pancreatic mass or cyst  • Constitutional symptoms | • FUO  • Hepatomegaly  • Jaundice  • Elevated ALP  • SOL  • Hepatic abscess |

## EVALUATION FOR SUSPECTED ABDOMINAL TUBERCULOSIS

| Peritoneal TB | Gastrointestinal TB | Perianal TB | Pancreatic Hepatobiliary TB |
|---|---|---|---|
| • **Ascitic tap**   Cytology (lymphocyte predominance, absence of malignant cells)   SAAG: <1.1 gram/dL   Culture, NAAT   Ascitic **ADA**: >39 U/L  • **Imaging**   Ultrasound: Ascites, lymph nodes, bowel thickening, for tissue acquisition for cytology & microbiology | • **Imaging:**  › CT or MR enterography (preferred): bowel thickening, strictures, necrotic LN  › CT chest may also be done  • **Endoscopic biopsies**: UGIE for esophageal/gastroduodenal/ileo-colonoscopy for intestinal TB is mandatory to acquire tissue  • **Histology**: Caseating granuloma specific; confluent granuloma & ulcers lined by histiocytes suggestive  • **Microbiology**: Culture, NAAT  • Barium studies: if endoscopy/CT unavailable | • Uncommon  • **Imaging:** MRI pelvis/Endoanal ultrasound/EUS  • Tissue acquisition for histology & microbiology | • Malignancy more important concern  • Needs imaging/ Endoscopic ultrasound guided tissue acquisition  • Refer to higher centre |

## FOLLOW UP

| Definitive Abdominal TB  (Microbiological positive, Caseating  granulomas) | Clinically Diagnosed Abdominal TB (Consistent clinical/radiological picture,  Elevated ascitic ADA, granuloma on his- tology, exclusion of differential diagnosis) | TREATMENT: |
|---|---|---|
| START ATT (2HRZE, 4HRE) | START ATT (2HRZE, 4HRE) | • Start treatment & follow-up as per NTEP guidelines  • 1st line treatment for adults & children with abdominal TB: 2HRZE/4HRE  • Extend duration of treatment in cases of inadequate response  Refer for surgical management for complications [intestinal obstruction (due to strictures), perforation]. Consider endoscopic dilatation for treatment for accessible strictures  Refer for biliary drainage in case of Jaundice due to biliary obstruction (hepatobiliary obstruction/pancreatic TB) |

End of therapy: Document mucosal healing in colonic & upper GI TB
• Imaging in small bowel disease to document healing
