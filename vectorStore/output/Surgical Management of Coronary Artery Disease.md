# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
ICD-10-125.10

For the medical
management of
**Acute Coronary
Syndrome**,
**Chronic Stable**
angina please
refer to
respective STWs

## HEART TEAM APPROACH
Decision to operate is a joint decision of the
heart team consisting of a Cardiac Surgeon,
Interventional Cardiologist, attending
Cardiologist or primary physician and the
patient
CONSIDER DEFINITIVE SURVIVAL BENEFITS OF
CABG BEFORE MAKING A FINAL DECISION*

This approach is based on:
*   Clinical presentation of the patient
*   Morphology and extent of coronary artery
    lesions
*   Condition of the left ventricle, its ejection
    fraction, associated mitral regurgitation,
    and left ventricular aneurysm
*   Associated comorbidities

## PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT

### PRE OPERATIVE REQUISITES
*   ECG
*   Echocardiography
*   Stress testing
*   Catheter coronary
    angiography
*   + Viability assessment
*   Evaluation for conduits

### EVALUATION FOR CO-MORBIDITIES
Medical conditions such as
diabetes, hypertension, obesity
*   Carotid Doppler if age > 60 yrs,
    h/o TIA/stroke
*   Neurological evaluation
*   USG for renal arteries, abdominal
    aorta and ilio femoral arteries in
    clinically relevant cases
*   Pulmonary function tests
*   RFT/LFT, lipid profile, TSH
*   Screening for viral and bacterial
    infections

## PRE-OPERATIVE MEDICATION
**Beta-blockers**
should not be
discontinued to
avoid acute ischemia
**Statins** should be
continued till day of
surgery or initiated if
not previously started
Angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors and
similar drugs might be
discontinued 1-2 days prior
to surgery
Before elective surgery, discontinue Aspirin 48 hours and other
anti-platelet drugs at least 5 days before surgery. Add LMW
heparin in high thrombogenic conditions like atrial fibrillation,
recent coronary/renal stenting, prosthetic heart valve in-situ,
limb ischaemia, and left ventricular clot
