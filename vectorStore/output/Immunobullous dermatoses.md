# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## IMMUNOBULLOUS DERMATOSES
ICD-10-L13.8

### WHEN TO SUSPECT?
*   Appearance of fluid-filled, itchy or painful blisters (either flaccid or tense) on skin, over a normal or erythematous base
*   Appearance of raw, erythematous erosions ± crusting on skin
*   Appearance of erosions/ blisters inside oral cavity, eyes, nose and genitals

### EXAMINATION
*   Are the blisters flaccid or tense?
*   Are the erosions crusted?
*   Do the blisters contain clear or hemorrhagic fluid?
*   Are the blisters umbilicated?
*   Is the base of the blisters erythematous/ urticarial?
*   Are the blisters healing with or without scarring?
*   Are they healing leaving behind hyper/hypopigmentation?
*   What is the color of the crust?
*   Are mucosae involved?

### AUTOIMMUNE BLISTERING DISEASES
*   **Pemphigus vulgaris**/ variants
*   **Pemphigus foliaceus**/variants
*   **Bullous pemphigoid**
*   **Pemphigoid gestationis**
*   **Mucous membrane pemphigoid**
*   **Linear IgA bullous diseases**/ chronic bullous disease of childhood
*   **Dermatitis herpetiformis**
*   **Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita**
*   **Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus**

### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
*   Age at onset and duration of blistering
*   History of any recent drug intake
*   History of prior varicella/ chicken pox
*   History of similar illness in family
*   History of itching, pain, burning
*   Predominant sites affected
*   Associated photosensitivity

### DIAGNOSIS OF AUTOIMMUNE BULLOUS DISEASES
*   **Likely pemphigus group of autoimmune bullous diseases**
    *   Flaccid blisters/ erosions + crusting on skin ± mucosae
    *   Usually seen in adults; can rarely affect children
*   **Likely sub-epidermal autoimmune bullous diseases**
    *   Tense, small to large blisters, containing clear or hemorrhagic fluid, on an itchy erythematous base, commonly healing with hypopigmentation + scarring
    *   Seen in children, adults and elderly (most common is **bullous pemphigoid**)
*   Get a **Tzanck smear**
*   Get a biopsy for histopathology from margin of a lesion
*   Get a peri-lesional biopsy for direct immunofluorescence, if facility is available

### RED FLAG SIGNS
*   Fever + chills and rigors
*   Hypotension (indicating hypovolemia due to fluid loss or sepsis)
*   Altered sensorium (indicating dyselectrolytemia or sepsis)

### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES
*   **Bullous Impetigo**, **Varicella**, **Stevens Johnson Syndrome/TEN***
*   **Epidermolysis bullosa**, a hereditary blistering disease with onset in neonatal period or infancy and predominantly affecting pressure sites; presence of scarring on limbs, acral areas, trunk and abnormality of the teeth or nails
*   Consider **Congenital syphilis** in a neonate- get **VDRL** for mother and child
    *   Refer to STW on **Bacterial Infections**; **Varicella and Herpes Zoster** and **CADR Part B**

### GENERAL MEASURES
*   Monitor temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate
*   Administer antibiotics if lesions are infected and foul smelling
*   Fluid-electrolytes balance
*   Get hemogram, basic biochemistry including renal and hepatic function tests, blood sugar
*   Get pus culture and if sepsis is suspected, also blood culture
*   Supportive management
    *   Clean non-adherent dressings
    *   Maintain hygiene with normal soap bath
    *   Topical antibiotics
    *   Aspiration of large blisters with 18G needle if needed
    *   Avoid deroofing the blisters as the roof of the blister acts as a natural dressing

### PEMPHIGUS (START TREATMENT ONLY IF FACILITY FOR MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS OF TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE)
*   Mucosal/mucocutaneous with body surface area <5%
    *   Oral **Prednisolone** (0.5 mg/kg/day), with one or more of the following
        *   **Azathioprine** (2-3 mg/kg/day)
        *   **Mycophenolate mofetil** (35mg/kg/day, start at a lower dose)
        *   **Cyclophosphamide** (1-2 mg/kg/day)
        *   **Methotrexate** (0.3mg/kg/week)
        *   **Dapsone** (100-150 mg/day)
*   Mucocutaneous with body surface area >5%
    *   At primary level-Stabilize patient, initiate general measures and refer to a specialist/ tertiary level
    *   To be managed at a tertiary level
        *   **Dexamethasone**- **Cyclophosphamide** pulse therapy
        *   **Rituximab**

*   Child < 5 years
*   Erosions with peripheral tense blisters
*   Urticarial base
*   Face/peri-genital involvement

### CHRONIC BULLOUS DISEASE OF CHILDHOOD

### EPIDERMOLYSIS BULLOSA
*   Maintain oral hygiene (if involved)
    *   Chlorhexidine mouth wash
    *   Brush teeth with pediatric brush with small head and soft bristles
    *   Avoiding eroding gingival margin
*   Maintain skin hygiene (if involved)
    *   Diluted potassium permanganate bath/potassium permanganate compresses on localized lesions/ thick crusted lesions
    *   Emollients/coconut oil application
    *   2% savlon scalp wash
*   Encourage oral intake (fluids and calories); consider other comorbidities
