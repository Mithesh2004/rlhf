# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**PAEDIATRIC LYMPH NODE TUBERCULOSIS**
ICD-10-A18.2

## WHEN TO SUSPECT?
*   Persistent enlargement of lymph node for >2 weeks in one or more areas in cervical/axillary /inguinal regions
*   Size > 2 cm or matted lymph nodes ± chronic sinus
*   With/without associated systemic symptoms: fever, cough, poor appetite, weight loss
*   With no evidence of recent scalp/skin lesions of draining area
*   Cold abscess / chronically discharging sinus over neck, axilla, or groin

TB is unlikely if: the lymphnodes are small (< 2 cm) AND are persisting for a long time (months to years) without any systemic symptoms

## INVESTIGATIONS
Essential
*   Lymphnode aspirate:
    *   Send for **NAAT** (also **MGIT** culture, particularly if the patient is at risk of **DRTB**)
    *   Smear for **AFB**

Desirable
*   Lymphnode cytopathology (If **NAAT** and smear negative)
*   Lymphnode Biopsy (Core/Excision)
*   Chest X-ray - should particularly be done if **FNAC** not possible
*   Hemogram with peripheral smear
*   Cytopathology

## DIAGNOSTIC
Peripheral Lymph node > 2cm in one or more sites

## TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT

## TREATMENT AND RESPONSE
*   Treatment should be started and follow-up should be conducted as per **NTEP** guidelines
*   Treat with 2 **HRZE** + 4 **HRE** (standard doses) if new case & Rifampicin resistance not detected or not known
*   If retreatment case or any other risk factor for **DRTB**, detailed & swift investigations for **DRTB** are advised before starting treatment
*   Disappearance of constitutional symptoms with decrement or no increment in lymph node size suggests response to treatment
*   Increment in lymph node size with disappearance of constitutional symptoms may suggest paradoxical reaction, provided drug resistance has been ruled out
*   Increment in lymph node size without disappearance of constitutional symptoms suggests drug resistant TB/alternate cause

Do not treat for TB based on only positive mantoux test or **FNAC** suggestive of reactive lymph node with negative **NAAT/AFB** on smear
Children with disappearance of constitutional symptoms with no increase in lymphnode size at the end of 6 months therapy, can be kept on follow-up with no extension of therapy

## WHEN TO REFER TO AN EXPERT?
*   Diagnosis is not established with **FNAC/NAAT**
*   Surgical facility is not available to do excision or core biopsy
*   **DR** is suspected due to any reason including non-response and the facility for **DRTB** testing are not available
*   If there is any pointer towards possible malignancy e.g. skin or mucosal bleed or significant pallor or generalised adenopathy irrespective of the size or associated hepato-splenomegaly

## BCG LYMPHADENITIS
*   Age is usually < 2 years
*   Axillary and or supraclavicular lymphnode on the same side as **BCG** vaccination (usually given on the left)
*   No systemic symptoms in immunocompetent children
*   Treatment:
    *   Wait and watch if small
    *   If large and suppurative, repeated aspiration or rarely incision and drainage is required
*NAAT or AFB smear positivity can not differentiate between BCG and MTB
