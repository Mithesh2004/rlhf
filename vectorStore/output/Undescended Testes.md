# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
UNDESCENDED TESTIS (CRYPTORCHIDISM)
ICD-10-Q53.9

## WHAT IS CRYPTORCHIDISM?
*   Absence of one or both testis in the scrotum
*   Cryptorchidism can be:
    *   True undescended testis arrested along normal line of descent
    *   Ectopic Testis: arrested outside line of normal descent

## WHAT TO ASK?
*   Testis are absent in scrotum since birth or present initially and later disappeared
*   Any history of torsion-redness/ pain or bulge in the inguinal region/ lower abdomen

## WHAT TO SEE?
*   Testis palpable anywhere along normal line of descent:
    *   Superficial inguinal ring, Inguinal canal, Deep inguinal ring
*   Testis palpable outside the normal line of descent:
    *   Pubic tubercle, Perineum, Thigh, Opposite scrotum, Penis
*   Testis not palpable (impalpable undescended testis)
*   Associated anomalies: hernia, hydrocele, hypospadias, ambiguous genitalia, poorly developed ipsilateral scrotum, contralateral testicular hypertrophy
*   Rule out retractile testis (which does not require surgery): If testis manoeuvrable into the scrotum and stays there by itself. Needs regular follow up to confirm continuing descended position of testis

## RED FLAGS REQUIRING SPECIAL MANAGEMENT
*   Possibility of **Disorders of Sexual Differentiation (DSD)** to be considered if:
    *   Bilateral undescended testis with hypospadias
    *   Unilateral undescended testis with severe hypospadias
    *   Undescended testis with torsion - red painful lump in the undescended testis
    *   Undescended testis with large inguinal hernia

## INVESTIGATIONS
### ESSENTIAL INVESTIGATIONS
*   No investigation is essential for diagnosis or localisation of testis.
*   Routine blood and urine investigations required for anaesthetic fitness

### OPTIONAL INVESTIGATIONS
*   Hormonal test (HCG stimulation test for bilateral undescended testis)
*   MRI scan in cases suspected to be DSD
*   Diagnostic laparoscopy in impalpable UDT (can be combined with therapeutic procedure)

### SPECIAL SITUATIONS
*   **DSD**: hormonal assay, USG, genitogram, karyotyping
*   Syndromic child: genetic assessment, karyotyping, hormonal assays
*   Undescended testis with torsion: USG Doppler

## MANAGEMENT
Guiding Principle: Diagnosis made at birth and reconfirmed at 3 and 6 months.
Further management if descent has not occurred.

### SPECIAL SITUATIONS
*   **DSD**- needs complete evaluation and treatment planning based on genotype, phenotype and psychological counselling
*   Undescended testis with torsion - needs immediate exploration and orchiopexy/orchidectomy
*   Undescended testis with large inguinal hernia- needs early surgery before waiting for 6 months due to the risk of obstructed hernia

### FOLLOW UP
*   Open orchiopexy- Discharge same evening/ next day
*   Laparoscopic orchiopexy- Discharge within 24-48 hours
*   Further FU
    *   1st week- local edema/ hematoma/tenderness
    *   1st, 3rd month- ensure testis position in scrotum and normal size
    *   Annual examination – ensure position and adequate growth till adulthood
    *   Adult FU for fertility status

## ABBREVIATIONS
*   UDT: Undescended testes
*   DSD: Disorders of sexual differentiation
*   FU: Follow up
