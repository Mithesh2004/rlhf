# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**NEUROINFECTIONS**
ICD-10-G03.9

Acute onset-hours to days

SYMPTOMS

Alteration in sensorium

With/without fever/
headache/vomiting/seizures

DIFFERENTIAL
DIAGNOSIS

Vascular-ischemic/hemorrhagic
stroke

Infections
viral/bacterial/fungal/protozoal
meningoencephalits/brain abscess

Metabolic encephalopathies

Seizures/postictal state

AT PRIMARY CARE LEVEL

Intoxications-drugs/toxins

Check Airway/Breathing/Circulation

## ESSENTIAL

*   Rule out circulatory shock, ongoing convulsions and hyperthermia/hyperpyrexia (core temperature > 40.5°C
    or hypothermia (< 36.5°C)
*   Establish IV access-urgent blood for hemogram/sugar/electrolytes/malaria testing-peripheral smear/rapid
    antigen detection
*   Correct hypoglycemia (blood sugar 50 mg/dl) with IV 100ml of 25% dextrose solution
*   If seizing- IV/IM **Lorazepam** 0.1 mg/kg followed by loading with **Phenytoin** 20 mg/kg weight at a rate of
    50 mg/minute
*   When IV access not available-intra nasal or buccal **Midazolam** 0.2 mg/kg/intra rectal **Diazepam** 0.3-0.4 mg/kg
*   Urgent referral to higher centres with intensive care facilities

## AT SECONDARY CARE LEVEL( TALUK, DISTRICT) HEADQUARTERS HOSPITAL

In addition to all the steps given above :

### ESSENTIAL
*   Establish and maintain airway: Intubate if GCS<8, impaired airway reflexes, abnormal
    respiratory pattern, signs of raised ICP, oxygen saturation <92% despite high flow oxygen,
    and fluid refractory shock
*   Inj **Thiamine** 100 mg IV
*   Stomach wash/activated charcoal administration-if history or suspicion of drug overdose/
    non corrosive poison intake
*   Start treatment for cerebral malaria-first dose of IV **Artesunate** 2.4 mg/kg OR
    **Quinine** 20 mg/kg bolus
*   Emergency CT/referral to centre with 24 hour CT facilities

### CRITERIA FOR REFERRAL

### DESIRABLE

*   Neuroimaging-CT with contrast -to rule out
    hemorrhage/infarcts/focal edema or lesions
*   Blood cultures aerobic/anaerobic
*   First dose of empirical treatment of pyogenic
    meningitis-Inj **Ceftriaxone** 2 g + Inj **Vancomycin**
    500 mg.
*   Add Inj **Ampicillin** 2 g if older than 50 years /
    immunocompromised along with Inj
    **Dexamethasone** 8 mg
*   Fundus examination, CSF study to rule out
    meningoencephalitis-if imaging rules out any
    mass lesions/herniations.
*   Urgent referral to higher centres with Intensive
    care facilities

### NOT
RECOMMENDED

*   Stomach wash
*   Inj Mannitol
*   Inj Steroids

### CRITERIA FOR
REFERRAL

*   Altered
    sensorium/seizures
    /focal
    deficits/hemodyna
    mic instability
    -where imaging
    and ICU
    management are
    required.

*   Altered sensorium/seizures/focal deficits/hemodynamic instability -where imaging and ICU management are required.
*   If no definite diagnosis achieved after preliminary investigations

## AT TERTIARY CARE HOSPITALS-SELECTED DISTRICT HOSPITALS/MEDICAL COLLEGES

*   Neuroimaging-MRI/CT with contrast to rule out abscess/herniations.
*   If abscess-emergency neurosurgical consultation for favour of aspiration -open/stereotactic
*   Blood cultures-aerobic/anaerobic
*   CSF analysis-biocehmistry/cytology/gram staining/culture-bacterial, AFB and fungal/viral PCR/TB-PCR/fungal antigen

Empirical antibiotic (within 30 minutes of arrival)
If suspecting pyogenic meningitis-Inj **Ceftriaxone** 2 g+ Inj
**Vancomycin** 500 mg+ Inj **Ampicillin** 2 g if older than 50 years or
immunocompromised+ Inj **Dexamethasone** 8 mg IV
Continue empirical treatment till culture yields causative
organism, then tailor treatment as per sensitivity reports for 10-14
days.
Steroids to be stopped after 48 hours, unless any other compelling
indications-adrenal insufficiency/TBM

| Viral-Herpes simplex/Zoster  | Cerebral malaria |
| :----------------------------- | :----------------- |
| Inj **Acyclovir**             | Inj **Artesunate** 2.4 mg/kg IM or IV 3 doses
| 500 mg IV                   | 12 hours apart and then OD /
| 8 hourly for                 | Inj **Quinine** 20 mg/kg IV stat followed by 10mg/kg
| 10 days                     | TDS till patient can take orally, then
|                              | oral **Artesunate**+**Pyrimethamine**/Sulphadoxine for
|                              | 3 days OR oral **Quinine** 10 mg/kg TDS for total 7
|                              | days + **Doxycycline** 3 mg/kg OD for 7 days. |

| Raised ICP | SIADH  | COMPLICATIONS | Hydrocephalus | Vasculitis |
| :--------- | :----- | :------------- | :------------- | :--------- |

\*If uncomplicated-back referral to Secondary care centre for completing treatment regimen/monitoring.

## CRITERIA FOR DISCHARGE

*   Afebrile, hemodynamically stable, seizure
    free >48 hours
*   Diagnosis and treatment plan made and
    initiated.
*   Continuation of treatment with monitoring can
    be ensured for the prescribed duration.
