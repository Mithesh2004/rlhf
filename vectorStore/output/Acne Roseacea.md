## ACNE AND ROSACEA
ICD-10-L70-71

Acne is a common dermatosis of adolescence and often persists into adulthood

Rosacea often mimics acne but has distinct management issues

## ACNE
*   Comedones (open-blackheads, closed-whiteheads) ± any one or more of the following
    *   Papules, pustules
    *   Painful nodules containing pus
    *   Cysts
    *   Scarring
*   Sites: Face and/or trunk
*   Symptoms: None/pain/pricking

## WHEN TO SUSPECT?
### ROSACEA
*   Photosensitivity
*   Persistent **erythema, telangiectasia** ± papules and pustules in absence of comedones
*   Sites: Convexities of the face (cheeks, forehead, nose, chin)
*   Bulbous enlargement of nose- **rhinophyma**
*   Symptoms: Sensitivity to hot and spicy food, and emotional triggers

## USEFUL INFORMATION
*   Acne and rosacea can co-exist
*   It is important to treat acne early so that scarring is minimal
*   In Indian scenario, consider 'topical corticosteroid induced acne and rosacea'

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR CLINICAL EVALUATION
*   History of cosmetics/topical steroid use- as such, or in combination with creams/fairness creams
*   Age of onset usually around puberty; onset before 8 years of age requires hormonal evaluation
*   History of recent drug intake (>fortnight/month)- Drug induced acne
*   History of contact with cutting oils/halogens (ingestion of iodides/ bromides)
*   History of menstrual irregularities (oligomenorrhea), weight gain and hirsutism- look for polycystic ovarian syndrome
*   History of premenstrual flare
*   Persistence or onset/recurrence after 25 years of age
*   History of dry and gritty eyes- requires ophthalmologic evaluation for ocular rosacea

## ACNE VARIANTS AND DIFFERENTIALS
*   Acne conglobata: Severe scarring on trunk and face with nodular lesions
*   Drug induced acne (with **corticosteroids/antiepileptic drugs/ antitubercular drugs/vitamin and protein supplements**): Extensive, monomorphic papules and pustules in absence of comedones
*   **Topical corticosteroid induced acne**: Hypertrichosis, shiny, thin skin, pigmentary changes with papulo-pustules
*   Hormonal acne: Adult female with seborrhea, hirsutism, androgenetic alopecia, insulin resistance and PCOS, premenstrual flare, menstrual irregularities and prominent involvement of mandibular area
*   Occupational acne: Predominantly comedones with history of exposure to cutting oil/petroleum products
*   Acne excoriee: Predominantly picked and excoriated lesions with prominent pigmentation
*   Acne fulminans: Fever and bone pains in association with severe necrotic acne lesions
*   Hidradenitis suppurativa: Association to consider when axillae/groins/ other flexures are involved with polyporous comedones/ pustules/ nodules/abscesses/scarring

## DIFFERENTIALS OF ROSACEA
*   Connective tissue diseases like **lupus erythematosus or dermatomyositis**: Photosensitivity, presence of Raynaud's phenomenon, arthralgia, muscle weakness, dyspnea, dysphagia, oral/genital ulcers, abdominal pain, frothy urine, seizures, or alopecia
*   Steroid induced rosacea: Photosensitivity, hypertrichosis, atrophy and pigmentary changes, prior history of topical corticosteroid application for a long time
*   Seborrheic dermatitis: Predominant involvement of nasolabial folds, eyebrows with erythema and greasy scales
*   Contact dermatitis or atopic dermatitis: Significant itching, exudation and crusting

![ACNE VULGARIS](ACNE VULGARIS)
![ACNE EXCORIEE](ACNE EXCORIEE)
![DRUG INDUCED ACNE](DRUG INDUCED ACNE)
![NODULOCYSTIC ACNE](NODULOCYSTIC ACNE)
![ROSACEA](ROSACEA)

## ACNE MANAGEMENT
*   Stop unsupervised topical corticosteroid and cosmetic use on face
*   Clean face with soap/ mild cleanser
*   Mild-moderate acne: 2.5% Benzoyl peroxide gel or 0.025% Tretinoin cream or 1% Adapalene gel + Clindamycin gel for local application, at night time
*   Moderate acne, not controlled with topicals: Cap Doxycycline 100mg OD for minimum of 4-6 weeks
*   Severe nodulocystic acne: Isotretinoin treatment at tertiary level after documentation of normal lipid profile and liver functions
*   Acne fulminans: start Prednisolone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day and refer to higher center
*   Hormonal acne: Treatment with anti-androgens at tertiary level
*   Drug induced acne: Stop offending drugs if feasible; treatment as per severtiy as detailed above

## ROSACEA
*   Avoid triggers (alcohol, caffeine, spicy food, cosmetics, topical steroids)
*   Photoprotection
*   Mild papulopustular rosacea: topical Azelaic acid (15%) or Metronidazole (1%) or Ivermectin (1%)
*   Moderate disease, not controlled with topicals: Cap Doxycycline 100mg OD for minimum of 4-6 weeks
*   Severe/phymatous/ ocular rosacea: refer to a specialist for low dose Isotretinoin/interventional treatment
