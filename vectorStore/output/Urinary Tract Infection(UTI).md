DETERMINE UTI TYPE

## SIMPLE CYSTITIS/LOWER UTI
Dysuria, urgency, frequency

## PYELONEPHRITIS/ UPPER UTI
* Fever
* Chills and rigors
* Loin pain, pelvic pain

* Toxic and sick appearance

## COMPLICATED UTI
* History of stones, congenital

* All males (except
simple cystitis)

MANAGEMENT

## PRIMARY CARE
* History and Examination
* Look for red flag signs and
refer
* Refer special groups
* Treatment in primary care
    * Acute cystitis females
    * Acute cystitis males
* Treatment
    * Nitrofurantoin
    * Trimethoprim
    * sulphamethoxazole
* Symptomatic relief

## MALE UTI
*Acute cystitis/simple UTI
    * Rx Men for 7 days
    * Nitrofurantoin* 100 mg PO BD x
7d
    * TMP/SMX 1 DS tab PO BD x 7d
    * Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BD x 7 days
    * Levofloxacin 750 mg OD x 5 day
    * Acute cystitis is not to be referred
*ALL OTHER UTI IN MALES-REFER
    * Pyelonephritis or complicated UTI
    * Pelvic/perineal pain (prostatitis)

## PRIMARY/SECONDARY LEVEL

### INITIAL ASSESSMENT
* History
    * Symptoms
    * Recurrent UTI
    * Diabetes
    * Congenital
malformations
    * Stones
    * Immunosuppression
* Examination
    * Temperature, renal
angle tenderness,
genital exam

### CYSTITIS/UTI IN FEMALES
* Empirical RX (only
symptoms no tests
needed)
* Nitrofurantoin* 100
mg
PO BD x 5d
* TMP/SMX 1 DS tab
PO BD x 3d
* If no response refer
to higher centre
*Avoid if GFR <45, caution in elderly

Plenty of Urine alkalinizer recommended eg citrate
Avoid if patient on nitrofurantoin
water

## SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT
* Phenazopyridine
200mg tid for 2 days
* Local Estrogen creams for recurrent
UTI in post menopausal women
* Paracetamol
for pain
* Cranberry
can be used

## RED FLAG SIGNS - REFER
* Pyelonephritis
* Complicated UTI
* Special situations (Children, pregnancy,
males except simple cystitis, catheter UTI)
* Non response within 3 days of AB
* Recurrent UTI

## TERTIARY LEVEL
* Send for culture
* Imaging if no response to antibiotics in 48 hrs
* Urology services if obstruction

### PYELONEPHRITIS
*Empiric Outpatient:*
* Urine c/s
* Consider initial dose of a parenteral
agent
    * Ceftriaxone 1-2 g IV/IM x 1
    * Gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV/IM x 1
* Followed by
    * Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BD x 7d
    * Levofloxacin 750 mg PO OD x 5 d
    * Cefuroxime 500 mg PO BD x10-14d
    * Amoxy clav x10-14 days
    * TMP-SMX 1 DS BD x 7-10 days
*Empiric Inpatient :*
* Ceftriaxone 1-2 g IV once daily+ /-AMP
* Gentamicin +/-AMP
* Others as per c/s- Carbapenem,
Piperacillin Tazo
* IV therapy required until afebrile x
48 hrs, then switch to PO If no
response in 3 days imaging

### PREGNANCY UTI
* Urine culture at 1st
antenatal visit
* For asymptomatic
bacteriuria/acute cystitis:
    * Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO
BD x 5-7 d (avoid near-
term)
    * Cephalexin 500 mg PO
QID x 5-7 d
    * TMP/SMX 1 DS tab PO BD x
5-7 d (avoid in 1st trimester
& near term; supplement
with multivitamin
containing folic acid)
* Check repeat urine c/s
7days after Rx to confirm
clearing
* Repeat urine culture in
each antenatal visit
* If recurrent- Antibiotic
prophylaxis till term

### CATHETER UTI
Rx all male UTI

* Rx of asymptomatic
CAUTI NOT
recommended

* Urinary catheters
should be removed as
soon as not required
* If indwelling catheter
for >2 weeks and is
still indicated,
replacing the catheter
is recommended
* Symptomatic CAUTI
    * (Fever, back pain, new
onset delirium, rigors)
* Send culture
* Rx as complicated
UTI
* No role of routine
antibiotic prophylaxis
for prevention

### MALES WITH PROSTATITIS
* UTI symptoms+ pelvic
pain/ fever
* Refer
* Urine culture & MSU
Digital rectal exam-
tender prostate
* Older >35 yrs-
Septran DS BD
Levofloxacin 500mg OD,
ciproflox 500 mg BD
Avoid nitrofurantoin
* Young males-
Doxy 100mg bd/azithro
1 gm/oflox 300mg BD
for chlamydia + Single
dose of Ceftrioxone
250mg IM for
gonorrhoea
* Rx- 6 weeks
* Imaging to rule out
abscess

### RECURRENT UTI
* Uncomplicated
RUTI
    * post coital voiding
and post coital
antibiotic
* Low dose
nitrofurantoin 50
mgX 6 months
    * Single strength
septran x 6
months
    * Or norflox 200mg,
ciproflox200mg
cephalexin 250mg
* Vaginal cream in
post menopausal
* Complicated RUTI
* Urology referral
* Cystoscopy,
urodynamics (post
menopausal)

### ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA
* No symptoms
* Bacteria in urine culture
>105CFU/ml
* No treatment required

* Exceptions when you
should treat
    * Pregnancy
    * Before any urological
intervention

* Pregnancy UTI,
Catheter UTI may also be
managed at secondary
level.

### LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES

    * Urinary bladder catheterisation for infants
with upper tract UTI
* Older children
    * Upper UTI- IV antibiotics
gentamicin, amikacin, ceftriax
one
    * Lower UTI- oral cefixime, oflox,
ciproflox, amoxyclav
* Duration of Rx
    * Upper UTI-10-14 days
    * Lower UTI 7-10 days
    * Adolescents 3-5 days
* REFER
* Upper UTI(PN), infants UTI, recurrent UTI
* PREVENTION
* Avoid constipation, clean washrooms

### FIRST URINARY TRACT INFECTION*
* Age <1 yr
    * Ultrasound
    * MCU
    * DMSA renal scan
* Age >5 yr
    * Ultrasound
* If ultrasound
abnormal:
    * MCU and DMSA
scan
* Age 1-5 yr
    * Ultrasound
    * DMSA scan
    * MCU if ultrasound or
DMSA scan is abnormal
* All patients with recurrent UTI need
detailed evaluation with
ultrasonography DMSA scan and MCU
