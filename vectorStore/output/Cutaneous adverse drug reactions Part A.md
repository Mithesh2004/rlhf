# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## CUTANEOUS ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS- PART A
ICD-10-L27.0

Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR) are undesirable clinical manifestations to a drug, which include predictable or
unanticipated side effects, with or without systemic involvement

### COMMON TYPES OF CADR

| NON- SEVERE CADR | SEVERE CADR |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Fixed drug eruption** | **Angioedema/ Anaphylaxis*** |
| **Maculopapular/ Exanthematous reactions (FDE)** | **Erythema multiforme/ Stevens Johnson syndrome/ Toxic epidermal necrolysis*** |
| **Drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome/ DRESS*** | **Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis** |

*Refer to separate STW on Urticaria/ Angioedema, and CADR Part-B for DRESS/ Stevens Johnson syndrome/ Toxic epidermal necrolysis

| GENERAL PRINCIPLES | TIMELINES FOR DRUG REACTIONS AND SOME TYPICAL EXAMPLES |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| *   Common presentation: Sudden onset of an itchy rash that is symmetrically distributed and spreads rapidly. May have had a previous similar allergic reaction.
*   Withdraw: The offending drug(s) immediately, except life saving drugs (if they are not the suspected drugs)
*   Take necessary measures to prevent similar events (record on patient's medical chart, educate, provide allergy card etc.)
*   Recognize danger signs
    *   Mucosal lesions, purpuric lesions, skin tenderness, bullous lesions (peeling/ sloughing of skin)
    *   Systemic symptoms: High grade fever, jaundice, decreased urine output
*   Action required: Prompt and urgent care at a specialised centre. Apart from maintenance of vitals, withdrawal of all drugs, initiation of oral or intravenous corticosteroids, care of the eye, evaluation of secondary infection/sepsis are important
| * 5-15 minutes: Anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema
* Few hours: Reactivation of fixed drug eruption
* Few hours- 2 weeks: Maculopapular exanthem, erythema multiforme, Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, first episode of FDE
* 4- 12 weeks: DRESS syndrome, Dapsone syndrome, anticonvulsant induced hypersensitivity syndrome

### 1) FDE

| HISTORY ELICITATION |
| ----------- |
| *   History of prior adverse drug reaction
*   Patients on polypharmacy: list all recently introduced drugs and/or dosage increments. However, all drugs should be kept in suspect list
*   Concomitant viral infection or illnesses affecting drug metabolism or excretion (eg. chronic kidney disease)

*   Distinctive drug eruption: usually recur at the same site on drug re-exposure
*   Acute FDE: dusky red-violaceous plaques with or without vesiculation or bullae
*   Common sites: lip, genitalia, proximal extremities, low back, sacrum
*   Local symptoms: pruritus, burning, and pain; solitary or numerous (latter is difficult to differentiate from toxic epidermal necrolysis). Resolve with persistent hyperpigmentation
*   Clinical variants: bullous, generalised, pure mucosal
*   Common drugs that cause FDE: Sulfonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones, NSAIDS, dapsone, antimalarials, barbiturates, nitroimidazoles

| MANAGEMENT | REFER TO HIGHER CENTER IF |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| PRIMARY HEALTH CENTRE | SECONDARY LEVEL CARE | TERTIARY LEVEL |
| *   Withdraw the drug
*   General management: Bullous/ moist/oozy lesions- normal saline compresses
*   Topical steroid: Betamethasone valerate cream BD for cutaneous lesions
*   Antihistamines -Tab Pheniramine maleate 25 mg BD/TID for itching
*   Review patient in 1 week | *   Continue treatment as described at primary care level
*   If severe: add short course of oral steroids: Prednisolone 0.5 mg-1 mg/kg for 3-5 days | *   Admit the patient if the episode is generalized and severe
*   Histopathology in doubtful cases
*   If the oral mucositis is severe, consider parenteral steroids
*   Provocation tests may be done after resolution of symptoms (usually after 1-6 months) by an oral challenge with each suspected individual drug consecutively |
|  |  | *   There are atypical symptoms
*   Uncertain diagnosis
*   Severe reaction (multiple lesions, bullae, severe mucosal lesions, systemic symptoms) |

### 2) MACULOPAPULAR/EXANTHEMATOUS REACTIONS
*   Abrupt onset, erythematous maculopapular eruption
*   Typically starts on the trunk, spreads symmetrically to extremities. Dependent areas may have purpuric lesions
*   Usually accompanied by mild systemic symptoms- pruritus, low grade fever, mild eosinophilia
*   All drugs taken in the last 4 weeks are suspects. May manifest within 48 hours if the patient has taken the drug previously
*   Commonly observed with co-trimoxazole, cephalosporins, anti-tubercular drugs, aminopenicillins, quinolones, dapsone, NSAIDS, anticonvulsants, nevirapine, abacavir, allopurinol, leflunomide
*   Differential diagnosis: Viral exanthem, Rickettsial rash, HIV, Kawasaki disease (in children)
*   Fever and prodromal symptoms (coryza, malaise) occur before the development of rash in most viral exanthems and the drug history is usually negative prior to it

| MANAGEMENT | RED FLAG SIGNS |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| PRIMARY CARE | SECONDARY CARE | TERTIARY CARE |
| *   Withdraw the suspect drug(s)
*   Pheniramine maleate 25 mg TID
*   Calamine lotion
*   Refer to higher center if symptoms persist or red flag signs present | *   Confirm the diagnosis by history and clinical findings
*   Admit if red flag signs are present
*   Laboratory tests: CBC (Eosinophilia supports the diagnosis), LFT, serum creatinine, urine M/E
*   Treatment: in severe cases, prednisolone 0.5-1 mg/kg/ day x 5-7 days (after ruling out infection) | *   Admit if red flag signs are present
*   Confirm diagnosis of drug rash
*   Additional lab tests if required: ANA, HIV, skin biopsy
*   Consider DRESS if rash is progressing or significant organ involvement is evident |
|  |  | *   Mucosal involvement
*   Purpuric lesions
*   Bullous lesions
*   Skin tenderness
*   Facial/acral edema
*   Erythroderma
*   Systemic symptoms - High grade fever, hepatitis, renal involvement, significant eosinophilia |

### DRUG PROVOCATION TEST
In the absence of any reliable in vitro test in clinical setting, oral drug challenge is the only way to detect the responsible drug

*   Usually undertaken when drug avoidance is impractical, especially in case of polypharmacy or life saving medicines (e.g. antituberculous therapy)
    *   Take a written consent prior to challenge
    *   Contraindicated in active illness or pregnancy
    *   Assess the risk benefit ratio
    *   Caution: patients on antihistamines, oral steroids and tricyclic antidepressants may have a modified response to the challenge
    *   A negative test only indicates that the patient is not allergic to the drug at the time of challenge
    *   The dose of drug for challenge depends on the severity of the previous reaction and the pharmacokinetic profile
*   Drug provocation should always be done
    *   After admission/ under observation except in cases with FDE
    *   Usually in the daytime so that the faintest erythema is appreciated
    *   It should be treated immediately and aggressively with an appropriate dose of systemic corticosteroid which may be required for only 1-2 days
        *   Drug provocation in cases with DRESS has to be avoided or if provoked, a prolonged retreatment is required
        *   In case of SJS-TEN drug provocation should be done only if the drug cannot be avoided. Provocation is preferred with a chemically unrelated molecule
    *   Intradermal tests can be done in IgE mediated reactions
    *   Patch test has a low sensitivty and should not be relied upon in severe cADR
