# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## FRACTURE DISTAL END RADIUS
ICD-10-S62

## RISK FACTORS
*   Old age
*   Osteoporosis
*   Female
*   Post menopause

## PRESENTATION
*   Pain over distal radius
*   Swelling and ecchymosis
*   Deformity - commonly Dinner fork or spade
*   Painful restriction of wrist motion

## EXAMINATION
*   Swelling and ecchymosis
*   Deformity
*   Tenderness
*   Limited active and passive wrist motion

## INVESTIGATIONS
**Essential:** Radiographs of wrist AP, lateral and oblique views

**Desirable** (In patients with trivial trauma):
Distal radial fractures may be the first opportunity to evaluate and treat osteoporosis to reduce the risk of future fragility fractures
*   Serum calcium, Serum phosphorous, Serum alkaline phosphates
*   Serum vitamin D levels, Serum Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)
*   BMD all three sites

**Optional:** CT scan for comminuted fractures and for planning surgery

## MANAGEMENT

### PRIMARY CARE
**Simple fracture**
Refer to higher centre after:
1.  Adequate analgesia
2.  Immobilisation of the limb

**Open fracture**
1.  Refer to open fracture STW

### Emergent referral:
*   Open fractures
*   Neurovascular Deficit
*   Concomitant trauma
*   requiring immediate admission

### SECONDARY/TERTIARY CENTRE
**Simple fracture**
1.  Adequate analgesia
2.  Immobilisation of the part

**Open fracture**
1.  Look for Median nerve function, dysfunction/compartment syndrome
2.  Distal radial and ulnar pulses
3.  Rule out compartment syndrome

## TRY INITIAL CLOSED REDUCTION IN ALL DISPLACED RADIUS FRACTURES

```

### Guidelines for operative intervention
*   Radial shortening of >3 mm
*   Dorsal tilt of >10 [degrees]
*   Intra-articular step-off of >2 mm

*   A majority of pediatric distal radius fractures are inherently stable and can be treated with a short period of immobilization with a cast or splint

## FOLLOW UP
*   Conservatively treated fractures are managed for 4-6 weeks in cast
*   To check for fracture displacement, angulation subsidence and fracture healing, serial images are necessary at 1 week and 2 weeks follow up
*   If fracture displaces in follow up, may require re-reduction/surgery
*   Exercises should be initiated early (Shoulder, elbow and finger ROM during cast application and wrist ROM after removal of plaster)

### ABBREVATIONS
*   AP: Antero-posterior
*   CT: Computed Tomography
*   ORIF: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation
*   ROM: Range of Motion
