# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
MALE INFERTILITY
ICD-10-N46.9

## 1
### WHEN TO SUSPECT?
*   Inability to conceive
    even after one year of
    regular unprotected
    intercourse.

*   Evaluation earlier
    than one year if
    female age is >35yrs,
    family history of
    infertility or very
    anxious couples.

*   Infertility Incidence is
    10-15%. Male factor-
    contributory in 50%
    cases.

### HOW TO PROCEED?
*   Both partners
    examined
    simultaneously *

*   Ensure
    marriage is
    consummated,
    couple has
    frequent
    timed
    intercourse
    with the
    knowledge of
    ovulatary cycle.

*   Male factor is an under
    recognised problem and the
    failure to recognise often
    leads to social and
    psychological adverse
    effects. Often the male is
    evaluated once the female
    has been examined
    thoroughly and this delays
    the treatment. Greater the
    duration of infertility lesser
    the chance of success.

### AIM
*   To ascertain contributory male
    factor
*   Identify potentially correctable
    conditions
*   Identify incorrectable condtions
    that may or may not be amenable
    to **Assisted Reproductive
    Technique (ART)**
*   Identify underlying medical
    conditions responsible for
    infertility

### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
*   Body habitus (obesity,
    Klinefelter's). Secondary sexual
    characters, gynecomastia
*   Penis: hypospadias,
    epispadiasis, chordee,
*   Testes: volume, consistency,
    masses, contours
*   Epididymis: flat, turgid,
    nodularity. Vas deferens
    -present/absent thickened or
    beaded
*   Cords-presence of **varicocele**.
*   Inguinal or scrotal scar.
*   Rectal examination: cyst, dilated
    seminal vesicles.

### HISTORY
*   Age of partners and duration of
    infertility.
*   Use of contraception and
    lubricants.
*   Knowledge of sexual cycle,
    technique, frequency.
*   Sexual and ejaculatory dysfunction,
    volume of ejaculate
*   Medical illness: STD, diabetes,
    recent fever, chronic bronchitis and
    any debilitating medical conditions
*   H/o Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy
*   Congenital anomalies,
    cryptorchidism, hypospadias,
    Chordee
*   Testicular torsion, drug history,
    trauma and swelling
*   H/o past surgeries(hernia repair,
    orchiopexy, retroperitoneal
    surgery)
*   Family history
    (infertility,consanguinity,genetic
    disorders),
*   Exposure to environmental toxins
    (pesticides, herbicides, chronic heat
    and radiation (sauna bath, tight
    non cotton undergarments, laptops
    & mobile)
*   Partner history: Any menstrual
    abnormality, infertility evaluation
    till date

### INVESTIGATIONS
**SEMEN ANALYSIS (ESSENTIAL)**
*   At least two-samples 1-2 months apart; Abstinence of 1-3 days.; Collected in sterile, medical grade plastic wide mouth containers.
*   Provided within the lab or transported within an hour at room temperature and examined immediately
*   WHO 2010 criteria for normal report. Volume: >1.5, ml Sperm conc.: >15 million/ml, Sperm motility: >40% Progressive > 32%, Sperm morphology: >4% normal
    forms, Leukocyte density: <1 million/mL
    Rule out sexual
Normal Semen Analysis:
dysfunctions, Anatomic
abnormalities, Female
factor and unexplained

**DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES ACCORDING TO SEMEN ANALYSIS REPORT**
*   Low volume semen: Incomplete.   **Azoospermia:**
    Collection, Retrograde       **Oligo-astheno-teratospermia:** Isolated Asthenospermia:
    ejaculation, Ejac. duct          Antisperm antibodies, Sperm structural defect, Hypogonadism
    obstruction, Cong. Absence of  Multiple defects: Varicocele, Cryptorchidism, Genital tract
    VasDeferens, Hypogonadism          infection, Systemic illness, Prolonged abstinence, Drugs
    (Sulfasalazine, NFT, Colchicine, Chemotherapy, GnRh analogs,
Note: If a patient is unable to produce semen consider retrograde      Spironolactone, Ketokonazole, Anabolic steroids, cocaine, alcohol.
ejaculation and anejaculation. Need further evaluation.          Chemicals: heavy metals, herbicides, organic solvents, fungicides,
                                 pesticides)
    **Obstructive**
    (Epididymal, vasal)
    **Nonobstructive:** (Genetic,
    Chromosomal, Hormonal,
    CT/RT, Post torsion testes,
    orchitis, Cryptorchidism,
    Idiopathic)

**OPTIONAL INVESTIGATIONS**
*   Hormonal assay: Serum FSH, LH, Prolactin, Testosterone, Estradiol, T/E ratio
*   Culture: Urine, Semen, Prostatic fluid, Antisperm antibodies, Viability assay, Sperm function tests, Scrotal USG & doppler, TRUS, Genetic studies,
*   Testicular biopsy (Multiple bilateral preferable)

### MANAGEMENT
*   History and Physical examination(PE)
*   Proper Semen analysis
PHC/CHC
Normal Semen report: (Rule out unconsummation, sexual dysfunction, anatomic abnormailities)
Abnormal Semen report:
*   Refer to Urologist/infertility centre
*   Preventive measures: Avoid gonadotoxins, gonadotoxic drugs, smoking, tobacco, chronic heat,
    excess use of mobiles; Encouraging healthy life style: Nutritious diet, regular physical exercise,
    avoid stress, use of antioxidants and vitamins(Vit. C, Vit E, Zinc)
*   Female partner to be evaluated by gynecologist
*   Management of reversible nonsurgical causes (Infections etc.) and surgical cause i.e. varicocoele if
    surgeon available.
*   For further evaluation refer to district/tertiary hospital.

DISTRICT HOSPITAL
*   Hormonal assay and Testicular biopsy
*   Management of sexual and ejaculatory dysfunction
*   Management of Varicocele and Hypogonadotropic
    hypogonadism
*   ART: AIH/AID and counselling for adoption.

TERTIARY LEVEL
*   Additional testing:TRUS, Genetic, ASA, Sperm
    function tests
*   Advanced surgery: Microsurgical VVA, VEA,
    Varicocelectomy, TURED, Sperm retreival
    techniques, Cryopreservation and sperm banking
*   Advanced ART: IVF-ET/IVF ICSI
