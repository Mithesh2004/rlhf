# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
NEONATAL JAUNDICE IN INFANTS ≥ 35 WEEKS
ICD-10-P59.9

Approach to
neonatal
jaundice

## VISUAL ASSESMENT
*   Examine the baby in bright natural/ white fluorescent light
*   Make sure the baby is naked and no yellow/ off white background
*   Examine blanched skin
*   Assess severity of jaundice

## LOOK FOR THESE RISK FACTORS
*   Gestation < 38 weeks
*   Previous sibling requiring treatment for jaundice
*   Blood group incompatibility (ABO/Rh)
*   High prevalence of G6PD deficiency
*   Exclusively breast fed baby with weight loss >3% per day; or >10% cumulative
*   Total serum bilirubin (TSB) / Transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) value in the high/ high-intermediate risk zone

## ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY OF JAUNDICE
| KRAMER ZONES | APPROX SERUM BILIRUBIN |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| 1 Face and neck             | 4 to 6 mg/dL              |
| 2 Chest and upper abdomen | 8 to 10 mg/dL             |
| 3 Lower abdomen and thighs| 12 to 14 mg/dL            |
| 4 Legs and arms/forearms  | 15 to 18 mg/dL            |
| 5 Palms and soles         | >15 to 20 mg/dL           |

Clinical
examination
every 12 hrs
during the
initial 3 to 5
days of life;
use TcB if
available

**ASSESS IF THE BODY HAS SERIOUS JAUNDICE*?**

**SERIOUS JAUNDICE**
*   Visible jaundice in first 24 hrs OR
Yellow palms and soles anytime OR
*   Signs of **acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE)** like poor suck/feeding, lethargy, hypotonia OR
*   Abnormal posturing such as arching, retrocollis, opisthotonus, convulsion, fever, high pitched cry

    G --> H[ENSURING OPTIMAL PHOTOTHERAPY
    Keep the baby naked (only small nappy to cover the genitalia
    and eye covers)
    Place the baby close to the lights
    Phototherapy can be interrupted for feeding & clinical procedures
    Encourage frequent breastfeeding
    Monitor temperature regularly
    Maintain equipment as per manufacturer's instructions
    Frequency of repeat TSB measurement depends on cause,
    severity, age and gestation
    Hemolytic jaundice: 6 to 8 hourly during initial 24 to 48 hrs
    Non-hemolytic jaundice: 12-24 hourly]
    H --> I[ENSURING OPTIMAL EXCHANGE
    BLOOD TRANSFUSION (EBT)
    Immediate EBT is
    recommended if infant shows
    signs of ABE or if TSB is above
    the recommended age and risk
    specific cut off
    Exchange volume = Twice the
    estimated blood volume of
    80-100 mL/kg]
    F --> J[DISCHARGE ADVICE
    Reinforce breastfeeding at
    discharge
    If discharged before 72 hrs;
    follow up at 48 to 72 hrs
    after discharge]
```

## SOME IMPORTANT DO'S ✅
*   Encourage frequent breastfeeding
*   Avoid exposure to naphthalene balls
*   Complete evaluation of newborn is important to evaluate for risk factors and underlying causes
*   Do pre-discharge risk assessment

## SOME IMPORTANT DON'TS ❌
*   Sunlight should not be used for treatment of hyperbilirubinemia
*   Do not rely on visual assessment/TcB while the baby is under phototherapy
*   Do not give phenobarbitone for treatment of hyperbilirubinemia
*   Do not stop breastfeeding

## ABBREVIATIONS
*   ABE: **Acute bilirubin encephalopathy**
*   DCT: **Direct coombs test**
*   EBT: **Exchange blood transfusion**
*   G6PD: **Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase**
*   TCB: **Transcutaneous bilirubin**
*   TSB: **Total serum bilirubin**
