# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
STROKE
ICD-10-163, 164

## WHAT IS STROKE?
*   An episode of
    neurological
    dysfunction caused by
    focal cerebral, spinal, or
    retinal infarction or
    haemorrhage

### SYMPTOMS
*   Numbness or weakness, especially on one side of
    the body
*   Loss of consciousness or altered consciousness
*   Decreased vision in one or both eyes
*   Language difficulties, either in speaking or
    understanding
*   Difficulty walking; loss of balance or coordination
*   Confusion or loss of memory
*   Swallowing difficulties
*   Paralysis of any part of the body, including face
*   Sudden, severe headache with no known cause
*   Neck pain
*   Nausea and vomiting

### WARNING SIGNS (BEFAST)
*   BALANCE: Loss of balance or
    coordination
*   EYES: Sudden blurred or double vision/
    sudden, persistent vision trouble
*   FACE: Deviation at the angle of the
    mouth
*   ARM: Arm Drift
*   SPEECH : Slurred speech or the inability
    to speak or understand
*   TIME: Act fast
*   Sudden new onset of headache or loss of
    consciousness
*   Sudden giddiness, vomiting and
    imbalance

## TYPES OF STROKE

### Ischemic stroke
Focal cerebral, spinal, or
retinal infarction

### Intracerebral haemorrhage
Focal collection of blood
within the brain
parenchyma or ventricular
system that is not caused by
trauma

### Subarachnoid haemorrhage
Bleeding into the
subarachnoid space

### Cerebral venous
thrombosis Thrombosis of
a cerebral venous
structure

### Transient Ischemic Attack
(ΤΙΑ)
Transient episode of
neurologic dysfunction caused
by focal cerebral, spinal cord,
or retinal ischemia, without
acute infarction

## PRELIMINARY MANAGEMENT
*   Assess and manage ABCS
*   Initiate cardiac monitoring
*   Maintain O2 saturation >94%
*   Establish IV access
*   Determine blood glucose and treat accordingly
*   Determine time of symptom onset or last known normal, and obtain family
    contact information, preferably a cell phone
*   Triage and RAPID TRANSFER of patient to nearest district hospital with CT
    Scan facility or Stroke center with facility for thrombolysis
*   Referal hospital to be notified to handle the referred patient with stroke

## INVESTIGATIONS

### ESSENTIAL
*   CT Scan head
*   ECG
*   Blood Sugar
*   Lipids
*   Renal parameter

### DESIRABLE
*   CTA
*   Echocardiogram

### OPTIONAL
*   MRI/MRA
*   Holter monitoring

## MANAGEMENT

### STROKE ONSET TIME: <4.5 HOURS
ISCHEMIC:
IV tPA (0-4.5 hrs) or
endovascular treatment
according to eligibility
and availability

### HAEMORRHAGIC:
*   Dysphagia assessment,
*   Blood pressure/blood sugar monitoring and IV fluids.
*   Prevention of Pneumonia
*   Prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis etc, monitor and record ECG

* RECOMMENDED DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

### ALL PATIENTS
*   Noncontrast brain CT or brain MRI
*   Blood glucose
*   Oxygen saturation
*   Serum electrolytes/renal function tests
*   Complete blood count, including platelet count
*   Markers of cardiac ischemia
*   BT, CT, Prothrombin time/INR
*   Activated partial thromboplastin time
*   ECG
*   FLP and carotid doppler (ischemic stroke)

### SELECTED PATIENTS
*   TT and/or ECT if it is suspected the patient is taking direct thrombin
    inhibitors or direct factor Xa inhibitors
*   Liver function tests
*   Toxicology screen
*   Blood alcohol level
*   Pregnancy test
*   Arterial blood gas test (if hypoxia is suspected)
*   Chest radiography (if lung disease is suspected)
*   Lumbar puncture (if subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected and CT
    scan is negative for blood)
*   Electroencephalogram (if seizures are suspected)

### STROKE ONSET TIME: >4.5 HOURS
Rapid Assessment, CODE Stroke, Blood pressure and Blood Sugar monitoring, NIHSS, Intravenous lines
Endovascular treatment with Mechanical thrombectomy using stent retriever (4.5 hrs to 24hrs) according to
eligibility

### SECONDARY PREVENTION
*   Aspirin (in ischemic stroke)
*   Antihypertensives
*   Antidiabetics
*   Lipid lowering agents

### REHABILITATION
*   Physiotherapy
*   Speech Therapy
*   Occupational Therapy
*   Vocational training

### DISCHARGE PLANNING
(checklist: drugs, diet, compliance,
exercises, health education)

FOLLOW UP at 2nd week, 1st month, 3rd
month and 6th month

## STROKE UNIT MANAGEMENT
*   Medical and Nursing staff: control of blood pressure; control of diabetes; swallow assessment; DVT prophylaxis; antiplatelet drugs
*   Rehabilitation staff:
    *   Acute phase: basic bed mobility, transfer techniques, communication training, prevention of complications
    *   Subacute and chronic phase: mobility, gait and balance training, training of activities of daily living (grooming, eating, dressing etc), bowel/bladder
        training, perceptual and cognitive rehabilitation, provision of assistive devices.

KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES
This STW has been prepared by national experts of India with feasibility considerations for various levels of healthcare system in the country. These broad guidelines are advisory, and are
based on expert opinions and available scientific evidence. There may be variations in the management of an individual patient based on his/her specific condition, as decided by the
treating physician. There will be no indemnity for direct or indirect consequences. Kindly visit our web portal (stw.icmr.org.in) for more information.
