# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
BACTERIAL SKIN INFECTIONS
ICD-10-L01, L73.9, L08, L02, L03, A46, L00

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT
* Skin hygiene, advise on handwashing/local hygiene, avoidance of oil application, adequate nutrition
* For recurrent/ severe lesions: evaluate for nasal carriage, diabetes, underlying skin conditions (scabies, atopic dermatitis)
* In immunocompromised/ diabetics: consider the need for gram negative coverage

## 1. IMPETIGO
### CLINICAL FEATURES
* Wet yellow brown crusts overlying red inflamed skin
* Types Non bullous (NBI; commoner), bullous (BI)
* Affected age group usually children
* Common sites Face (perinasal, perioral) > extremities; extensive with scabies/ atopic eczema

### MANAGEMENT
* Topical antibiotics for 5 days
* Oral antibiotics for extensive involvement or numerous lesions, lymphadenopathy or in outbreaks to prevent transmission

## 2. ECTHYMA
### CLINICAL FEATURES
* Black thick crust (eschar) with underlying ulcer & surrounding redness & edema

### MANAGEMENT
* Treat with oral antibiotics for 7 days
* Gentle crust removal may be attempted after soakage with sterile saline; topical antibiotics over the exposed ulcer

## 3. FOLLICULITIS
### CLINICAL FEATURES
* Hair follicle centred pustule/ papule
* Rule out non bacterial causes: oils, chemicals, waxing, epilation, occlusive dressing
* **RECURRENT FOLLICULITIS** Recurrent infection or outbreak in multiple members of family may indicate nasal *Staphylococcus aureus* carriage or human-pet transmission

### MANAGEMENT
* Topical antibiotics for 5 days
* Oral antibiotics for multiple lesions
* Anti-inflammatory: Paracetamol 500mg/Ibuprofen 400mg SOS for pain relief

## 4. FURUNCLE
### CLINICAL FEATURES
* Painful follicle centric nodule/ pus point/impending bulla/ ulcer with marked surrounding erythema, edema and induration

## 5. CARBUNCLE
### CLINICAL FEATURES
* Confluence of multiple closely spaced furuncles + pus draining from multiple follicular orifices
* Commonly nape of neck> breasts, buttocks in uncontrolled diabetes

## 6. CUTANEOUS ABSCESS
### CLINICAL FEATURES
* Painful, warm, red fluctuant skin swelling

### MANAGEMENT
**SMALL**
* Oral antibiotics +
* Topical antibiotics: to reduce contamination of surrounding skin

**LARGE**
* INCISION AND DRAINAGE
* Incision and drainage/debridement
* Ancillary antibiotics if systemic inflammatory signs, associated septic phlebitis, multiple/large abscesses, prominent cellulitis & immunocompromised state

* **HOSPITALIZATION AND IV TREATMENT FOR SEVERELY ILL PATIENTS**
* Inj Ceftriaxone 2g BD OR Inj Amoxicillin-clavulanate 1.2gm TDS
* Alternatively - Inj Clindamycin 600-900mg TDS

## 7. CELLULITIS
### CLINICAL FEATURES
* Acute spreading infection of skin involving subcutaneous tissue; Painful, red, tender, diffuse swelling mostly involving the limbs

## 8. ERYSIPELAS
### CLINICAL FEATURES
* A more superficial, bright red, edematous, painful area with a clear demarcated edge; common sites: lower extremities>face. Often associated with lymphangitis and lymphadenopathy; broken skin/ portal of entry may be visualised

### MANAGEMENT
**MILD**
* Typical cellulitis/ erysipelas with no focus of purulence

**MANAGEMENT**
* Outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics
* Elevation of affected area (to allow for dependent drainage); treatment of predisposing factors
* Anti-inflammatory (Ibuprofen 400mg BD, Indomethacin 75mg BD)

**MODERATE**
* Typical cellulitis/ erysipelas with systemic signs of infection

**MANAGEMENT**
* Hospitalization and parenteral antibiotics:
* Inj Ceftriaxone 2g BD OR
Inj Amoxicillin-clavulanate 1.2gm TDS
* Alternatively (allergic to penicillins) Inj Clindamycin 600-900mg IV TDS

**SEVERE**
* With poor response to oral antibiotics, immunocompromised, signs of deeper infection like bullae, skin sloughing or systemic signs of infection like hypotension, or with organ dysfunction

**MANAGEMENT**
* Empiric broad spectrum IV antibiotic coverage
* Vancomycin + Piperacillin/tazobactum
* Surgical debridement
* Sensitivity profile based modification of antibiotics

## INVESTIGATIONS
1. Swabs for gram staining and pus culture are desirable
2. Blood cultures and biopsies are not routinely recommended, but useful with co-morbid conditions (malignancy on chemotherapy, immunocompromised states, animal bites etc.)

## 9. STAPHYLOCOCCAL SCALDED SKIN SYNDROME
* Superficial peeling of skin due to toxin producing strains of staphylococcus
* Starts as tender and warm erythema and progresses to localised or generalised exfoliation with fever, malaise +/- dehydration and electrolyte disturbances
* Follows a local staphylococcal infection of either skin, throat, nose, umbilicus, or gut
* Bacteria cannot be demonstrated from blisters (cultures from original site may be positive)
* Treatment: preferably in-patient
* Mild cases: oral anti-staphylococcal antibiotics; severe cases: IV antibiotic
* Consider methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage
* Usually remits within a week in children, high mortality in adults

## PHARMACOTHERAPY
**ANTIBIOTICS FOR SKIN AND SOFT TISSUE INFECTIONS**

**PREFER B-LACTAMS**
* Amoxycillin 500mg TDS (25-50 mg/kg/day)
* Cloxacillin 500mg QID (50mg/kg/day)
* Cephalexin 250-500mg QID (25-50 mg/kg/day)
* Amoxicillin clavulanate combination: 625mg TDS

**IF ALLERGIC TO PENICILLINS**
* Erythromycin 500mg QID (40 mg/kg/day)
* Clindamycin: 300-600mg BD/TID (20mg/kg/day)

**FOR NASAL CARRIERS**
* 2% Mupirocin ointment for 5 days a month

**TOPICAL ANTIBIOTICS**
* Mupirocin cream 2%
* Fusidic acid cream 2%
* Framycetin cream 1%

### COMPLICATIONS
* Subcutaneous abscesses, blistering (often haemorrhagic), ulceration, tissue necrosis, myositis, septicemia

### RED FLAGS
* Temperature >100.4 °F, WBC>12,000 or < 4000/μL, heart rate > 90 bpm, or respiratory rate > 24/min may indicate sepsis
* Severe pain followed by deceptive absence may indicate necrotising fasciitis
* Dark discoloration of overlying skin

**IN ALL PATIENTS SUSPECT THE NEED FOR MRSA COVERAGE IF:**
* Poor immune status
* Severe systemic signs
* MRSA infection elsewhere
* If no improvement in 48-72 hours
* Penetrating trauma

**ORAL ANTIBIOTICS FOR SUSPECTED OR CONFIRMED MRSA INFECTION**
* Cotrimoxazole 2 DS tablets BD
* Doxycycline 100 mg BD
* Minocycline 100 mg BD
* Linezolid 600 mg BD

**IV ANTIBIOTICS FOR MRSA**
* Vancomycin: 15 mg/kg BD
* Linezolid: 600 mg BD
* Clindamycin: 600-900 mg TDS

ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY PATTERNS MAY VARY WITH REGION AND TIME
