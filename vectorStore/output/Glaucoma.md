# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
GLAUCOMA
ICD-10-H40.9
KEY POINTS

*   Glaucoma can be asymptomatic
*   Can lead to irreversible vision loss if not treated in time
*   Everybody ≥ 40 years age to be screened
*   Everybody with a family history of Glaucoma to be screened

## SCREENING CRITERIA
### HISTORY TAKING

*   Unilateral intermittent headache, blurring of vision, eye pain, coloured haloes
*   Previously diagnosed/glaucoma suspect
*   Treatment history - medical/surgical/laser and compliance with medication/follow up

### SIGNS

*   Abnormalities of optic nerve head (Cup to disc ratio > 0.7; asymmetry > 0.2)
*   **IOP** >20mmHg
*   Evidence of ocular co-morbidities that could lead to secondary glaucoma
*   Torch light examination: on shadow test - shallow anterior chamber and Iris changes (Iris atrophy and sphincter pupil atrophy)
*   Visual field defects
*   Evidence of previous surgery or laser
*   Evidence of intermittent angle closure glaucoma
*   *if normal but associated with other features think of normal-tension glaucoma

## DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS
### HISTORY

*   Highest baseline IOP before any treatment
*   Systemic Hypertension, Cardiovascular diseases, Transient ischemic attacks, DM
*   Systemic and ocular medications used
*   Any OTC medication especially steroid for allergy
*   Any ocular trauma

### EXAMINATION

*   Vision
*   Refraction
*   Ophthalmic examination including pupillary reflexes
*   IOP
*   Fundus examination
*   Anterior chamber depth with direct ophthalmoscope/ slit lamp biomicroscope with 90D

### ESSENTIAL
Slit lamp bio microscopy, AC Depth, gonioscopy, Pupillary reflex, Estimation of IOP (3 measurements), Visual field assessment

### DESIRABLE
Diurnal variation. Central Corneal thickness

### OPTIONAL
UBM, OCT, HRT, GCC for RNFLthickness

## EXAMINATION IN OPD

## SUGGESTED MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL BASED ON IOP

| IOP                | 25-30 mmHg                            | > 30mmHg                                    |

| First line         | First line drug-Prostaglandins/ẞ Blocker | Prostaglandins +<br>ẞ-Blocker+ Tab<br>Diamox 250mg TDS only x3 days |
|                    | (look for 15% IOP)                      |                                             |
| Review/Switch      | Review 2 weeks/switch to another drug  | Review 10 days<br>add brimonidine if required|
|                    | if nonresponder                         |                                             |
| Review frequency | Review after every 4 mths              | Review after every<br>3 mths if 'target' IOP|
|                    | if 'target' IOP achieved               | achieved                                    |

Fitness for Surgery
*   General health stable
*   BP ≤ 150/90mm Hg
*   Blood sugar (mg/dl) FBS < 140, PPBS < 180 / RBS < 200

## MANAGEMENT
### PHC
*   Evaluate for open angle(deep AC), narrow angle (shallow AC) with torchlight
*   Detailed history and examinations
*   Refraction for BCVA
*   Preliminary diagnosis
*   Referral to Ophthalmologist as soon as possible if IOP > 21, shallow anterior chamber or cup-disc ratio > 0.7
*   Counselling regarding spacing and phasing of glaucoma medication and reporting of side effects if any
*   Counsel that surgery is not a cure but a means to lower IOP to stabilize the disease. The follow up is mandatory and will remain, regardless
*   Counsel that stabilization of disease is available with regular treatment and follow up

### DISTRICT HOSPITAL
*   Refraction for BCVA
*   Detailed work up including, Slit lamp examination& AC Depth, IOP, Optic nerve head examn
*   Gonioscopy,fields and Diagnose, classify, advice as per Flow chart. point to point guided referral
*   Surgical intervention such as Yag Pl and Trabeculectomy
*   Counselling regarding spacing and phasing of glaucoma medication and reporting of side effects if any.
*   Counsel that surgery is not a cure but a means to lower IOP to stabilize the disease. The follow up is mandatory and will remain, regardless
*   Counsel that stabilization of disease is available with regular treatment and follow up

### TERTIARY CARE
*   Detailed work up as above
*   Optional investigations such UBM, OCT, HRT, GCC for RNFL thickness when necessary
*   Surgical intervention, YAG PI, Trabeculectomy, any other advanced procedure such as tube shunts.
*   Ensure Postoperative Follow up and compliance including collaboration with district hospital ophthalmologists
*   Counselling regarding spacing and phasing of glaucoma medication and reporting of side effects if any.
*   Counsel that surgery is not a cure but a means to lower IOP to stabilize the disease. The follow up is mandatory and will remain, regardless
*   Counsel that stabilization of disease is available with regular treatment and follow up

### RED FLAG SIGNS FOR URGENT REFERRAL
*   Acute angle closure attack*
*   IOP* > 30.
*   Loss of pupillary reflex with visual impairment.
*   Single eyed patient with glaucoma
*   initiate initial therapy for acute attack of angle closure glaucoma
    *   oral diamox, iv mannitol and pilocarpine 2 percent tds if confirmed narrow angle before yag PI

### Intervention:
Consult flowchart, pre-op topical broad spectrum antibiotics, QID for 1-3 days

### Aim of Glaucoma Management
*   Achieve target IOP with minimal fluctuation (Refer NPCB Guidelines)
*   Iridotomy in all primary angle closure patients.
*   Trabeculectomy or referal to higher center if target IOP not achievable

### Special instruction for glaucoma medication:
*   Punctal Occlusion'
*   Not to squeeze eyesafter instillation
*   1 drop in conjunctival sac

### INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY
*   IOP above target despite maximal tolerated medical therapy
*   Inability to review regularly
*   Unable to affford medications
*   Progession of the disease on maximal tolerated medical therapy
*   Non compliance

### QUALITY ASSESSMENT
*   Patient identifier, Age/Gender
*   Compliance with Follow up schedule and medications
