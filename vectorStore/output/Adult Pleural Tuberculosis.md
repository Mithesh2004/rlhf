# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
ADULT PLEURAL TUBERCULOSIS
ICD-10-A15.6

WHEN TO
SUSPECT?
INVESTIGATIONS
## HISTORY
*   Fever
*   Pleuritic chest pain
*   Cough
*   Breathlessness
*   Anorexia
*   Weight loss
*   History of TB contact

## EXAMINATION
*   Dullness to percussion
*   Decreased/absent
breath sound

## ESSENTIAL
*   CXR (to confirm pleural
effusion)
*   Sputum for AFB/NAAT
*   Refer immediately for pleural
tap
*   Thoracentesis
(ultrasound-assisted)
*   Pleural fluid analysis :
    *   Cell count (total and differential)
    *   Protein
    *   Glucose
    *   Gram stain
    *   Bacterial cultures
    *   Stain for acid-fast bacilli
    *   Adenosine deaminase (ADA)
    *   NAAT
    *   Cytology evaluation

## DESIRABLE
*   CT chest (before
pleural biopsy)
*   Pleural biopsy
(image-guided/thorac
oscopic) (If diagnosis
is uncertain)
*   Histopathology
*   MGIT

## DIAGNOSTIC

```mermaid

    A[Pleural effusion] --> B(Sputum examination and thoracentesis);
    B --> C{Sputum or pleural fluid positive for AFB or NAAT};
    C -- Yes --> D[Start anti-TB treatment];
    C -- No --> E[Pleural fluid ADA];
    E --> F{< 40 U/L};
    E --> G{40-69 U/L};
    E --> H{≥70 U/L};
    F -- No --> I[Pleural biopsy];
    I --> J[Treat based on results of biopsy and microbiological examination];
    G -- Yes --> K[Initiate empiric anti-TB therapy];
    G --> L[Age <40 years, fever, non-smoker, alternate etiology unlikely];
    L --> K;
    H --> M[Initiate empiric anti-TB therapy];
    B --> N[Alternate etiology:
    transudative, exudative
    (bacterial, malignancy)];
    N --> O[Treat accordingly];
    K --> P[If no response in 4 weeks];
```

## MANAGEMENT

## TREATMENT AND RESPONSE
*   As per NTEP
*   Therapeutic pleural tap can be done under
ultrasound assistance if the effusion is large, and
the patient is breathless

### WHEN TO REFER?
*   Facility for ultrasound assistance is not available
*   Diagnosis is not established after thoracentesis and
facilities for pleural biopsy is not available
*   Drug-resistant TB is detected: according to NTEP
*   Worsening pleural effusion on follow up

## FOLLOW UP
*   Most patients who respond to treatment will have
improvement in their general condition by 2
weeks, and significant improvement in pleural
effusion by 4-8 weeks
*   Disappearance of constitutional symptoms with
decrease in pleural effusion suggests
responsiveness to treatment
*   Increase in pleural effusion can suggest
    *   Paradoxical reaction or
    *   Drug-resistant TB or
    *   Alternative etiology
*   A follow up CXR at 4-8 weeks after starting ATT is
useful to assess progress
