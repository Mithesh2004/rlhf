# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**HEAVY MENSTRUAL BLEEDING (HMB)**
ICD-10-H90.5

**TO DO AT ALL LEVELS**

## HISTORY
*   Age
*   Parity
*   Detailed menstrual history including irregularities
*   Other medical illness: thyroid disorder,
    coagulopathy, jaundice etc
*   IUCD use
*   Lactation
*   Drug intake

## EXAMINATION
*   General
    *   Evaluate pallor
    *   Calculate BMI
*   Systemic
    *   CVS, RS and hepatosplenomegaly
*   Local examination (where indicated)
    *   P/S and P/V

## SUPPORTIVE TREATMENT
*   Reassurance
*   Hematinics
*   Tranexamic acid during episode of
    heavy bleeding

## MANAGEMENT OF HMB AT PRIMARY LEVEL
### HISTORY AND EXAMINATION

    A[Any Abnormality] --> B{Refer to\nHigher centre};
    C[No Abnormality] --> D{Adolescents};
    C --> E{Women of Reproductive Age};
    C --> F{Age > 40 years};
    D --> G{Supportive\nTreatment};
    G --> H{Tranexamic acid\n- OC Pills};
    H --> I{No Relief};
    I --> B;
    E --> J{R/o pregnancy*\nSpeculum examination\nPelvic examination};
    J --> K{No abnormaliity};
    K --> L{Contraception\ndesired};
    K --> M{Contraception not\ndesired};
    L --> N{OC Pills};
    M --> O{- NSAIDs\n-Tranexamic acid\n- Progestogens**};
    N --> P{No Relief};
    O --> P;
    P --> B;
    F --> B;
```

### INVESTIGATIONS
*   Hemoglobin
*   Complete Blood
    Count (CBC) with
    peripheral smear
*   Bleeding time /
    Clotting time
    (BT/CT)

* R/o Pregnancy in doubt especially in all women of reproductive age group after appropriate consent
** Amongst progestogens Norethisterone provides the best hemostasis

## MANAGEMENT OF HMB AT SECONDARY LEVEL (CHC)
### HISTORY AND EXAMINATION

    A[Adolescents] --> B{Married <40 years};
    A --> C{Married >40 years};
    A --> D{Post Menopausal};
    B --> E{Endometrial thickness\n< 12 mm};
    B --> F{ET>12mm or\nHigh Risk for endometrial\ncancer*};
    C --> G{Secretory/ Non Secretory\nendometrium without hyperplasia};
    C --> H{Hyperplasia without\natypia};
    C --> I{Hyperplasia with atypia/\nmalignancy};
    D --> J{Refer to higher\ncentre};
    E --> J;
    F --> K{Do endometrial sampling and send\nfor histopathological examination};
    G --> L{- NSAIDs\n- Tranexamic Acid\n- Combined OC Pills\n- Progestogens\n- LNG IUS};
    L --> M{If no relief,\nrefer to higher centre};
    H --> N{- Progestogens\n- Levonorgestrel-\nreleasing intrauterine\nsystem (LNG IUS)\nHormonal therapy to\ncontinue for 6 months};
    I --> J;
    K --> J;
    N --> M;
```

### INVESTIGATIONS
*   Hemoglobin
*   CBC with peripheral smear
*   BT / CT
*   ABO and Rh typing
*   Thyroid function test
*   USG of Abdomen & Pelvis

## MANAGEMENT OF HMB AT TERTIARY LEVEL
### HISTORY, EXAMINATION AND ULTRASONOGRAPHY

    B --> F{Treat underlying cause\nif present\n(thyroid disorders,\njaundice, coagulopathy\netc)};
    B --> G{In absence of obvious\ncause\n- NSAIDs\n- Tranexamic Acid\n- OC Pills\n- Progestogens};
    C --> H{- NSAIDs\n- Tranexamic Acid\n- OC Pills\n- Progestogens\n- LNG IUS\n- Ormeloxifene\n- Ablative Techniques};
    D --> I{Endometrial sampling - D&C/\nHysteroscopic guided};

    F --> G;
    G --> K{No Relief\nRefer to higher centre};
    H --> K;
    I --> L{-Conservative modalities\n- Progestogens\n- LNG IUS\n- Ormeloxifene\n- Ablative\ntechniques};
    J --> L;
    L --> K;
```

### INVESTIGATIONS
*   ABO and Rh typing
*   TSH
*   USG of Abdomen & Pelvis

### TREATMENT FOR ACUTE
### BLEEDING EPISODE
*   IV Tranexamic acid 1g stat
    slowly followed by oral
    Tranexamic acid 0.5-1g,
    6-8 hourly for 5 days
*   Blood transfusion if
    indicated

### HORMONE THERAPY
*   Norethisterone (max daily
    dose 40 mg)
    OR
*   Medroxyprogesterone
    acetate (max daily dose
    40 mg)
    Hormone therapy should
    be given orally daily in
    divided doses from the
    fifth day of the cycle for
    three weeks and repeated
    in a cyclical manner for
    total of 4-6 cycles of
    treatment

### HIGH RISK FOR ENDOMETRIAL
### CANCER
*   Patient having:
    *   Obesity
    *   Diabetes
    *   Hypertension
    *   PCOD

## COUNSELLING IS AN IMPORTANT ADJUNCT TO MANAGEMENT
## KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES
