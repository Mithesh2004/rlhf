# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
IMAGE GUIDED MANAGEMENT OF OBSTRUCTIVE JAUNDICE
ICD-10-K83.1

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION
*   Jaundice
*   Pruritus
*   Dark coloured urine & Pale stool

## COMMON ETIOLOGIES
*   **Non obstructive**: Hepatitis related- viral hepatitis (A,B,C,E,NASH, alcohol, auto-immune cirrhosis)
*   **Obstructive**: Mechanical obstruction
    *   **Benign**: stone, sludge, stricture, worm, primary sclerosing cholangitis, bilio-enteric anastomotic stricture (HJ stricture)
    *   **Malignant**: Carcinoma GB, hepatocellular carcinoma cholangiocarcinoma, hepatic metastasis, pancreatic head carcinoma, extrinsic compression by lymph node/mass, pseudotumor

## KEY TO DIAGNOSIS
*   In presence of jaundice
    *   High AST/ALT + relatively normal SAP/GGT suggests hepatitis
    *   Elevated SAP & GGT + relatively normal AST/ALT suggests obstructive etiology
*   USG* abdomen would mostly differentiate between obstructive and non-obstructive causes
*   Do not suspect obstructive jaundice if:
    *   AST/ALT elevation > 1000 IU
    *   ALP/GGT normal/mildly elevated (s/o hepatitis)
*   If non obstructive jaundice: refer to district hospital/tertiary care to be managed by physician (medicine/gastroenterologist/ hepatologist)

## RED FLAGS
*   Pain in right hypochondrium
*   Fever
*   Chills
*   Tachycardia & tachypnoea
*   Patients should be administered IV fluids & antibiotics- Cefoperazone + Sulbactam in a ratio of 1:1 administered IV 20-40 mg/kg/day in equal doses over duration of 6-12 hrs

## PHC
Patient with clinical features and/or red flag signs

## CHC/DISTRICT HOSPITAL
*   Clinical examination; hematological investigations - LFT, CBC, PT/INR and Imaging - USG abdomen
*   If cholangitis is suspected - Fluid resuscitation and IV antibiotics and refer to tertiary level care for further management

## TERTIARY CARE
*   Clinical examination, repeat hematological investigations if > 2 weeks. Imaging - MRCP to confirm diagnosis & look for level of obstruction, CECT abdomen to decide for definitive vs palliative care
*   Suspected cholangitis - Fluid resuscitation & I/V antibiotics
*   Biliary drainage (**PTBD/ERCP**) to make patient fit for surgery/palliative care (chemotherapy/radiotherapy)
*   PTBD preferred for high CBD/hilar obstruction, ERCP preferred in low CBD obstruction

## MANAGEMENT

### COMMON CAUSES OF BILIARY OBSTRUCTION

*   GB mass/cholangiocarcinoma causing biliary radicle dilatation (obstruction)
*   GB/CBD stone causing biliary dilatation
*   Periampullary mass causing biliary dilatation(obstruction)

### CLINICAL FEATURES
*   LFT
    *   Raised serum bilirubin with
    *   Markedly raised ALP and/or GGT
    *   Normal/mildly raised AST/ALT
*   If signs of cholangitis:
    *   Jaundice with fever, rigor, pain
        *   Urgent referral to higher centre

### MEDICAL MANAGEMENT FOLLOWED BY USG/MRCP
*   USG
    *   CBD/IHBR dilatation
    *   GB stone/Mass
*   MRCP
    *   Lower CBD obstruction: ERCP
    *   Higher common bile duct/Hilar Obstruction PTBD#
Ascertain level and cause of obstruction in the biliary tree
*   Lower CBD obstruction: ERCP preferred
*   High CBD obstruction: PTBD# preferred
*   Choledocholithiasis/other benign cause needing bile drainage
    *   ERCP
        *   PTBD# (If ERCP not possible)
*   Biliary tract malignancy
    *   CECT ABDOMEN
        *   Identify the malignancy and extent of disease
        *   Decide for definitive vs palliative care
        *   *USG ABDOMEN
            *   Gall bladder stone/mass
            *   Dilatation of Common bile duct/intrahepatic biliary radicles

Once the bilirubin starts reducing, the patient can be:
*   taken up for surgery or
*   chemo/radiotherapy
or refer back to regional cancer centre

### PERCUTANEOUS TRANSHEPATIC BILIARY DRAINAGE (PTBD)#
*   **INDICATIONS**
    *   Decrease bilirubin to commence appropriate therapy (surgical/palliative)
    *   Cholangitis (draining infected bile)
    *   Intense pruritus
*   **DAYS OF HOSPITALISATION**
    *   1-3 days (non-infected/no cholangitis cases)
    *   7-14 days (Cholangitis, can be prolonged in severely septic patients)
*   **CONTRAINDICATIONS**
    *   Deranged coagulation (correct before procedure)
    *   Emergent cases: infuse fresh frozen plasma (FFP) - 10ml/kg body weight prior to the procedure
    *   Elective cases: I/V vitamin K injection (5-10 mg) - 3 to 5 days
    *   Ascites (to be dried before therapy)
*   **PROCEDURAL DETAILS**
    *   External drainage for infected cases (aim to establish internal drainage with or without biliary stenting, once the infection is treated. In cases of long-term external drainage - electrolytes should be replaced for ongoing bile salt loss)
    *   Internal drainage using internal external drainage catheter for non infected cases else may be considered for primary biliary stenting

**#PTBD IN CHOLANGITIS**: IV antibiotics** and fluids to be started before the procedure: Cefoperazone+Sulbactam in 1:1 ratio, 20-40 mg/kg/day in equal doses after duration of 6-12 hrs; Piperacillin 4 gm +Tazobactam 0.5 gms every 8 hrs
*   External drainage till cholangitis subsides (normalization of leucocytosis, and draining bile to become clear - golden brown or light green)
*   Establish internal drainage once infection is treated
*   Plan for definitive/palliative therapy and manage same as described for non-infected patients
*   **OUTCOME MEASURES**
    *   Normal bile drainage through the catheter
*   **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**
    *   Reduction in bilirubin to make patient fit for required therapy
*   **AFTER CARE**
    *   Appropriate antibiotics**: Ofloxacin/Cefixime 200 mg 12 hrly for 3-5 days
    *   LFT & CBC
    *   Clinically stable patient with reducing bilirubin can be planned for biliary stenting/definitive surgery/discharge as per the requirement and suitability
*   **FOLLOW UP**
    *   Follow-up with IR in case of non-reducing or rise in bilirubin/sign of cholangitis/ stent block

## DEFINITIVE TREATMENT
*   PTBD followed by surgery

## PALLIATIVE TREATMENT
*   PTBD# followed by Biliary stenting
*   Chemotherapy/Radiotherapy
Patients to follow with respective physician (surgeon/medical or radiation oncologist) after successful biliary drainage and normalization of bilirubin

**Respective contraindications, risks and precautions, pediatric dose of antibiotics to be considered before prescription

*Patients with obstructive jaundice having no/ minimal IHBRD with distended GB may be considered for percutaneous cholecystostomy in emergent situations. Similarly, cholecystostomy may be a bridge to surgery in patients with pyocele/mucocele of GB
