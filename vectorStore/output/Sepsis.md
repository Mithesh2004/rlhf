## EXAMINATION

### CHECK FOR HISTORY OF
*   Prior treatment
*   Previous recurrent infections
*   Prior hospitalisation
*   Chronic systemic illness (congenital or acquired)
*   Immunization (age appropriate)

### GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

| Examination          |                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Lethargy**         | **Petechial rash**    |

| Pulse volume        | High volume as well as low volume/feeble pulse                                 |
| Capillary refilling time | > 3 seconds                                                                  |
| Blood pressure*     | (Systolic blood Pressure < 70 in <1 year)                                      |
| Heart rate and respiratory rate | (outside the age range)                                                            |
| Pulse oximetry      | (saturation <95%)                                                              |
|                     | >1 year child if systolic BP < 70+ Age (yrs) x2) or (lower than age range)     |

### SYSTEMIC EXAMINATION

*   Respiratory: Signs of respiratory distress - retraction, nasal flaring, grunting, crepitation on auscultation
*   CVS: Murmur, gallop rhythm
*   Per abdomen: Abdominal distension
*   CNS: *AVPU scale, signs of meningitis, seizures
*   Skin: Rashes
*   Bone & joints: Swelling, redness, tenderness

### SIGNS OF SEVERE DEHYDRATION
Diarrhoea plus any two of these: **Lethargy** or **unconscious**, not able to drink or drinks poorly, **Sunken eyes**, skin pinch goes back very slowly

## INVESTIGATIONS- (Based on symptoms and available facility)

*   **Essential** - Complete blood counts, peripheral blood film, urine routine, blood sugar, CRP, serum electrolytes, renal function test, liver function test
*   **Desirable** - Blood culture, blood gas, relevant cultures (based on symptoms), chest X-ray, specific illness- Malaria - rapid malarial antigen test, Dengue- dengue NS1, IgM, CSF study

## MANAGEMENT
### DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM
CHILD (2-59 MONTHS OF AGE WITH FEBRILE ILLNESS (WITH WARNING SIGNS)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[CHILD (2-59 MONTHS OF AGE WITH FEBRILE ILLNESS (WITH WARNING SIGNS)] --> B{POOR PERIPHERAL PERFUSION};
    B -- Yes --> C[With fast pulse, cold peripheries, poor pulse volume, CRT >3 seconds (Fast pulse: HR> 180 in < 12 month old child, HR >120 in >12 month old child)];
    C --> D[Admit, initiate treatment, refer to centre with facility of ICU, ventilation, 24 hour monitoring (if required)];
    D --> E[Start O₂ with face mask @ 4-6 lit/min, or hood @8-10 lit if not available nasal prongs 1-2 lit/min to maintain SpO2 >95%, Insert two IV cannulas, give first dose of antibiotics within first one hour];
    B -- No --> F[GOOD PERIPHERAL PERFUSION];
    F --> G[Admit or initiate treatment as per IMNCI guidelines²];
    G --> H["If there is improvement after 1st bolus and history of diarrhea present then - Continue"];

```

### Antibiotics
*   1. >3 months: (Inj Cefotaxime 50mg/kg/dose 6-8hrly), +(Inj Gentamicin 5-7.5 mg/kg single dose /day)
*   2. <3 months: (divided 6 hourly), +(Inj Gentamicin 5-7.5 mg/kg single dose /day)
*   3. If soft tissue infection: consider Inj Cloxacillin 200mg/kg divided 6 hourly or Inj Amoxicillin- Clavulanic acid 30 mg/kg/dose 8hrly)
*   Inj Adrenaline- 0.3x body weight in mg in 50 ml NS or 5% dextrose at 1 ml/hr will give 0.1 microgram/kg/min

### When to refer
*   Shock does not improve after 2nd fluid bolus
*   Signs of fluid overload
*   No facility for continuous monitoring.
*   Before referral counsel the parents and inform referring facility

### When to Suspect Cardiac Failure
*   History of underlying heart disease
*   History of forehead sweating/ suck rest suck cycle
*   Murmur
*   Hepatomegaly or basilar crept

If it is suspected be careful in giving fluid bolus

## DISCHARGE CRITERIA

*   Completion of antibiotics as per culture sensitivity
*   Afebrile for 48 hours
*   Vitals within normal limit for age
*   Good oral intake
*   Adequate urin output >1ml/kg/hr

### Complications
*   Respiratory failure (excessive increase in the respiratory rates and inability to maintain saturation> 94% with oxygen) -non-invasive (CPAP/BIPAP) or invasive ventilation
*   Congestive heart failure- Dobutamine / Milrinone infusion and Furosemide
*   Infections on other sites- explore and treat accordingly

## KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES

*DISABILITY (AVPU SCALE)* A Is the child Alert? If not; V Is the child responding to Voice? If not; P Is the child responding to Pain?; U The child who is Unresponsive to voice (or being shaken) AND to pain is Unconscious *Anything below A should be classify as danger sign
