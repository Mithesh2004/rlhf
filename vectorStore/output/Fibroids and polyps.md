*Norethisterone (max daily dose 40 mg) OR Medroxyprogesterone acetate (max daily dose 40 mg). Any hormone should be given orally daily in divided doses for a duration of three weeks and repeated in a cyclical manner for total of 4-6 cycles of treatment*

All theraputic options need to be explained to the patient including just keeping the patient on observation.

All patients of fibroid uterus do not necessarily need hysterectomy.
