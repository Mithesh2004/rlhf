# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
RATIONAL USE OF TOPICAL MEDICATIONS

## TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS (TCS)
*   Most commonly prescribed topical medication in dermatology
*   Because of quick results, it has high abuse potential
*   Unmonitored use can cause both local and systemic adverse effects

## COMMON TOPICAL FORMULATIONS AND THEIR USAGE

| Topical formulation | Key aspects of usage |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Cream | Emulsion of oil and water; preferred for oozy/wet lesions |
| Ointment | Semi-solid, greasy, occlusive; preferred for better penetration, especially over thick keratotic lesions |
| Gel | Aqueous or alcoholic monophasic emulsion  Liquefies upon contact with skin |
| Lotion | Preferred for greater cosmetic acceptance, and hairy areas  Usually thicker than a solution and likely to contain oil/water/alcohol |
| Aerosol foam/spray | Use lotions over hairy areas and larger body surface areas  A solution with pressurized propellant; alternative to lotion |
| Powder | Solid, for example, talc/corn starch; doubtful penetration/efficacy |

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR TCS USE
*   Before prescribing, make sure the dermatosis is steroid responsive
*   Rule out fungal and bacterial infections at the local site
*   Super potent and potent **TCS** usually, for a maximum duration of 2 weeks
*   For children and over face- only low potency **TCS**
*   For larger surface area, use finger tip unit (FTU) method for application of **TCS**
*   For use over smaller area, less than 1 FTU maybe required; advise not to apply beyond the lesion

## DOSE AND AMOUNT
Educate the patient about the optimum quantity (in grams) of TCS required

A single application to the whole body of an adult will require 20 to 30 g of product (cream/ointment/lotion)

An area of one hand (palm and digits) will require 0.3 g per application

No more than 45 g/week of potent or 100 g/week of a moderately potent TCS should be applied

Treatment under occlusion should be avoided; only prescribed by specialists

## FINGERTIP UNIT (FTU) METHOD FOR WIDESPREAD ECZEMA

## FEW ACCEPTABLE COMBINATIONS WITH TCS
Should be used only in specific situations and under strict supervision

*   **TCS**+ Fusidic acid 2% cream/ointment (for impetiginized eczematous lesions)
*   **TCS** + Salicylic Acid (3-6%) ointment (for thick hyperkeratotic eczema/psoriasis)
*   Topical Calcipotriene-**TCS** (for mild to moderate psoriasis)
*   Hydroquinone 2% + Tretinoin 0.025% + Fluocinolone Acetonide 0.1% Cream (use with great caution in melasma - high abuse potential)

## RATIONAL TOPICAL COMBINATIONS FOR ACNE
*   Clindamycin 1%+Tretinoin 0.025% gel
*   Adapalene 0.1% +Clindamycin phosphate 1%
*   Clindamycin 1% + Benzoyl peroxide 5% cream
*   Adapalene 0.1% + Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR TOPICAL ANTIBIOTIC USE IN ACNE
*   Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) alone, or in combinations with Retinoids/ Clindamycin are effective for mild acne, or in conjunction with a topical retinoid, or systemic antibiotic therapy for moderate to severe acne
*   BPO is effective in the prevention of bacterial resistance and is recommended for patients on topical or systemic antibiotic therapy
*   Topical antibiotics like Clindamycin are effective acne treatments, but are not recommended as monotherapy because of the risk of bacterial resistance

## MOISTURIZERS
*   One of the most commonly applied topical preparations for normal skin care and in diseased skin to improve barrier function of skin
*   Moisturizer alone are therapeutic in conditions like eczema and psoriasis
*   Bland, fragrance-free moisturizer should be preferred
*   Moisturizers in common use – white soft paraffin/light liquid paraffin, glycerin with water, coconut oil

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR TOPICAL SUNSCREEN USE
*   For photosensitive dermatoses like lupus erythematosus, liberal uniform film of sunscreen (2 mg/cm²) should be applied on sun-expoxed sites, and application should be atleast 15 minutes before sun exposure
*   Routine topical sunscreen use is not essential except in special situations with intense, prolonged sun exposure, such as mountaineering
