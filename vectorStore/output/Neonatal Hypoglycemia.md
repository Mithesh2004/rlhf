# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
NEONATAL HYPOGLYCEMIA
ICD-10-P70.4

## WHOM TO SCREEN FOR HYPOGLYCEMIA?
*   Preterm infants (< 37 weeks gestational age)
*   Low birth weight Infants (< 2500 g)
*   Small for gestation age (SGA): birth weight < 10th percentile
*   Large for gestation age (LGA): birth weight > 90th percentile
*   Infant of diabetic mother (IDM)
*   Sick infants (eg: sepsis, asphyxia, respiratory distress, shock, polycythemia, seizure)
*   Post exchange blood transfusion
*   Infants on intravenous fluids and parenteral nutrition

    Do not monitor blood glucose routinely in term healthy AGA infants

## SCHEDULE OF BLOOD GLUCOSE (BG) MONITORING (PREFEED)

| CATEGORY                           | TIME SCHEDULE              |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| At-risk infants                    | At 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours of life |
| Infants on IV fluids/parenteral nutrition | Every 6-8 hours              |

## HOW TO MONITOR BLOOD GLUCOSE (BG)?
*   Use Glucose reagent strips along with a glucometer
*   Low value (< 45 mg/dL) - Send a blood sample to the lab for confirmation
*   Do not delay treatment

    A[BLOOD GLUCOSE <45 mg/dL] --> B{LOOK FOR FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS
    • Stupor, lethargy, limpness
    • Jitteriness, tremors, convulsions
    • Episodes of cyanosis, apnea or tachypnea
    • Weak and high-pitched cry
    • Difficulty in feeding};
    B --> C{ASYMPTOMATIC
    Immediate supervised feeding
    Breastfeeding or a measured volume of
    expressed breast milk (formula milk if EBM
    not available) by paladai or gavage};
    B --> D{SYMPTOMATIC OR BG < 20mg/dL
    • IV bolus: 2 mL/kg 10% dextrose
    • Start IV infusion of dextrose at a
    glucose infusion rate (GIR) of 6
    mg/kg/min};
    C --> E{RE-CHECK BG AFTER 1 HOUR};
    D --> F{Re-check BG every 30 mins till 2 values
    ≥ 45 mg/dL & then every 6 hrs};
    E --> G{If BG ≥ 45 mg/dL
    Continue feeds
    Continue BG
    monitoring
    every 6 hourly
    for 24 hours};
    E --> H{Start IV glucose
    infusion if:
    BG < 45 despite one
    attempt of feeding
    OR
    Baby becomes
    symptomatic};
    H --> I{BG < 45 mg/dL
    Increase GIR @ 2
    mg/kg/min till max GIR 12
    mg/kg/min};
    I --> J{Refractory hypoglycemia:
    High (>12 mg/kg/min for 24
    hours) or persistent (> 7
    days) GIR requirement};
    J --> K{CONSIDER DRUGS* AND REFER
    TO HIGHER CENTRE};
    H --> L{BG ≥ 45 mg/dL
    Euglycemic for 24
    hours on IV fluids};
    L --> M{• Wean @ 2 mg/kg/min
    every 6 hourly
    • Increase oral feeds
    • Monitor BG every 6
    hourly};
    M --> N{Stop IV fluids when
    euglycemic on GIR 4
    mg/kg/min};

## PREVENTION OF HYPOGLYCEMIA
*   Support mother for early initiation and regular breastfeeding
*   Maintain normothermia
*   Do not feed 5%, 10% or 25% dextrose as a substitute for breast milk

## PRACTICAL POINTS
*   Avoid > 12.5-15% dextrose infusion through a peripheral vein
*   Use a syringe/ infusion pump to deliver glucose
*   Avoid frequent dextrose boluses
*   Send blood in fluoride or oxalate vial for laboratory glucose estimation
*   Always search for an underlying cause polycythemia, sepsis, meningitis, hypothermia, IUGR
*   Do not give antibiotics unless sepsis is suspected (refer to STW on sepsis)

*DRUGS FOR REFRACTORY HYPOGLYCEMIA
*   Hydrocortisone: 5 mg/kg/day IV in two divided doses
*   Diazoxide: 10-25 mg/kg/day PO in three divided doses
*   Glucagon: 300 µg/kg SC or IM
*   Octreotide: 2-10 µg/kg/day SC

## ABBREVIATIONS
*   AGA: Appropriate for Gestational Age
*   EBM: Expressed breast milk
*   IV: Intravenous
*   PO: Per oral
*   IM: Intramuscular
*   SC: Subcutaneous
*   IUGR: Intra uterine growth retardation

**SYMPTOMATIC AS WELL AS ASYMPTOMATIC HYPOGLYCEMIA CAN LEAD TO PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE**
