# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**ACUTE DIARRHEA**
ICD-10-R19.7

DIARRHEA IS
*   >3 loose or watery 
stools/ day
*   **Acute Diarrhea** 
<14 days
*   **Persistent diarrhea** 
>14 days
*   **Dysentery** – blood 
in stools

ASK FOR
*   Duration
*   Blood in stool
*   Vomiting, fever, cough, recent 
measles, HIV status (if 
known)
*   Immunization status and pre 
illness feeding practices
*   Fluids/ food/ drugs and other 
remedies taken during illness

EXAMINATION
*   General condition of child
*   Nutritional status (weight 
/weight for height / MUAC)
*   Classify malnutrition if any
*   Signs of **dehydration** & 
classify **dehydration**

SKIN PINCH TEST
*   Locate the area on the child’s 
abdomen halfway between the 
umbilicus and the side of the 
abdomen. 
*   Use thumb and first finger to pinch 
and not finger tips. 
*   The fold of the skin should be in a line 
up and down the child’s body. 
*   Firmly pick up all layers of the skin 
and tissue under them. 
*   Pinch the skin for one second and 
then release it. Look to see if the skin 
pinch goes back:
*   Very slowly (longer than 2 
seconds)
*   Slowly (skin stays up even for a 
brief instant) 
*   Immediately (normal)

REFER TO HOSPITAL
*   Severe malnutrition/ HIV
*   Severe **dehydration**
*   Hypernatremic (Na >145mmol/L) 
/ hyponatremic **dehydration** (Na 
<135 mmol/L)
*   **Dysentery** with age <1 yr/ measles 
in past 6 weeks/ **dehydration**/ 
sick
*   **Dysentery** with no improvement 
on antibiotics
*   **Persistent diarrhea** with 
**dehydration**
*   **Persistent diarrhea** with serious 
systemic infection such as 
pneumonia, sepsis, infants <4 
months of age, or when there is 
no improvement with treatment 
over 5 days

## MANAGEMENT
### CLASSIFY DEHYDRATION

Not enough signs to 
classify some or 
severe **dehydration**
*   2 of following:
    a) Lethargy / unconscious
    b) Sunken eyes
    c) Not able to drink/ drinking poorly
    d) Skin pinch - goes back slowly
*   2 of following:
    a) Restless , irritable
    b) Sunken eyes
    c) Drinks eagerly, thirsty
    d) Skin pinch - goes back very slowly

### NO DEHYDRATION: PLAN A
*   Fluids
*   Give extra fluids (as much as child 
will take) until diarrhea stops.
*   Use **WHO ORS** after each loose 
stool (in addition to usual fluid 
intake)
    *   Upto 2 yrs→ 50 -100 ml
    *   2 yrs or more → 100 -200ml 
*   On ORS packet check whether 
200ml or 1 litre of clean water is 
needed
*   Frequent small sips with spoon or 
cup.
*   If child vomits, wait 10 minutes 
then continue slowly.
*   Homemade fluids- salted rice 
water, salted yogurt drink, 
vegetable or chicken soup with salt 
and clean water, unsweetened 
fresh fruit juice and coconut water
*   Unsuitable fluids - carbonated 
beverages, commercial fruit juice, 
sweetened tea & coffee, other 
medicinal teas / infusions.
*   Zinc supplement (Zinc sulphate/ 
carbonate / acetate)
    *   2-6 months → **10mg/day** x 2weeks
    *   \>6 months → **20mg/day** x 2weeks
*   Counsel Mother/ Attender
*   Feeding advise
    *   Infants on breast feed, to 
continue more frequent breast 
feeding than usual.
    *   Those not on breast feed to 
continue their usual milk feed/ 
formula at least once in 3 hours.
    *   Give age appropriate foods to 
>6 months old based on their 
pre illness feeding pattern

### SOME DEHYDRATION: PLAN B
*   Manage in clinic /daycare facility with recommended 
amount of ORS (75ml /kg) over 4hour period

| WEIGHT | AGE < 4 months | 4 -11 months | 12 -23 months | 2 – 4 years | 5-14 years | 15 years or older |
|:--------|:---------------|:-------------|:--------------|:------------|:----------|:---------------|
|  | <5kg  | 5 – 7.9 kg  | 8 - 10.9 kg  | 11 – 15.9 kg | 16 – 29.9 kg | 30 kg or more |
| IN mL  | 200 - 400     | 400 - 600    | 600 - 800     | 800 - 1200   | 1200 - 2200  | 2200 - 4000      |

*   After 4 hours reassess the child, classify **dehydration** 
and select appropriate plan (A /B/C)
*   Give extra fluids, zinc supplement, feeding advise and 
counseling regarding danger signs* as in plan A
*   Follow up in 5 days if no improvement

### SEVERE DEHYDRATION: PLAN C

NO

NO

CAN YOU GIVE INTRAVENOUS 
(IV) FLUIDS IMMEDIATELY?

*   Start IV fluid immediately 
*   Ideal fluid is Ringer lactate solution / Normal 
saline (DNS in malnourished)

| AGE           | Infant (< 12 months) | Older        |
|:--------------|:----------------------|:-------------|
| FIRST GIVE 30 ML/KG IN | 30 minutes              | 1 hour       |
| THEN GIVE 70 ML/KG IN | 2.5 hours               | 5 hours      |

*   If child can drink, give **ORS** by mouth while 
the drip is set up
*   Assess heart rate/ respiratory rate/ BP/ CFT/ 
consciousness and recognize early shock
*   Refer for hospitalization
*   If prevalance of cholera – 
 Doxycycline single dose **300mg** or 
Tetracycline **12.5mg/kg** 4 times a day x 3 
days. For young children Erythromycin 
**12.5mg/kg** 4 times a day x 3 days
*   Associated vomitings –
 Ondanstetron **0.15 mg/kg/dose** IV/oral in 
addition to rehydration therapy
*   Reassess every 15-30 minutes till a strong 
radial pulse is present and then every hour 
 If **hydration** status is not improving, give IV 
drip more rapidly
*   After 6 hours (infants) and 3 hours (older 
patients) - evaluate for **dehydration** and 
choose the appropriate plan (A, B, or C) to 
continue treatment
*   Give **ORS** (about 5 ml/kg/hour) as soon as 
the child can drink: usually after 3-4 hours 
(infants) or 1-2 hours (children)
*   Observe for 6 hours after the child has been 
fully rehydrated. 
*   In hypernatremic and hyponatremic 
dehydration child appears relatively less ill / 
more ill respectively and needs to be 
referred for hospitalization

DISCHARGE CRITERIA 
*   Suffcient rehydration (indicated by wt gain 
&/or clinical status)
*   IV fluids no longer needed
*   Oral intake = / > losses
*   Medical f/u available 

### PATIENT EDUCATION
*   Danger signs*
*   Hygiene practices
*   Hand washing , proper disposal of excreta
*   Safe drinking water
*   Appropriate feeding practices

### INVESTIGATIONS
*   **Some dehydration**:
    *   Preferable Tests- electrolytes
*   **Severe dehydration**:
    *   Essential tests- CBC, electrolytes 
    *   Preferable Tests- Renal Function Tests, VBG
*   **In suspected cholera cases**:

stool culture
*   **Dysentery**: (no response to antibiotic in 2 
days) Preferable test- stool culture & stool 
routine for trophozoites of Ameoba
*   **Persistent diarrhea**: 
    *   Preferable test- stool routine microscopy, 
urine routine microscopy, urine culture , 
sepsis screen

### PERSISTENT DIARRHEA
*   Appropriate fluids to prevent or treat **dehydration**
*   Nutrition: 
    *   If breastfeeding, give more frequent, longer breastfeeds, day and night. 
    *   Other milk: replace with increased breastfeeding, or with fermented milk 
products, such as yogurt, or half the milk with nutrient-rich semi-solid food. 
    *   For other foods, follow feeding recommendations for the child’s age: give
 small, frequent meals (at least 6 times a day), and avoid very sweet foods or 
 drinks.
*   Zinc for 14 days
*   Supplement vitamins / minerals
*   Antimicrobial to treat diagnosed infection
    *   A) Intestinal infection:
        *   If blood in stool: Treat like **dysentery** 
        *   If stool routine suggestive of Amoebiasis: Treat for it
        *   If stool suggestive of cyst/ Trophozoite of Giardia: Give Metronidazole 
5mg/kg/dose x 8hrly x 5 -7 days
    *   B) Treat Non intestinal such as UTI / Otitis Media
*   Follow up in 5 days
*   Refer to hospital (See box)

### DYSENTERY
*   Treat **dehydration** according to assessment.
*   Ciprofloxacin **15mg/kg** twice a day and 
reassess after 2 days. 
    *   Improvement: 3 days of treatment
    *   No improvement → Cefixime **10 mg//kg/d**, 2 
div doses. Reassess after 2 days. If better 
complete 3 -5 days of treatment.
*   If stool routine positive for Ameobiasis : 
Metronidazole **10mg/kg/dose** 8 hourly x 7 
days (10 days in severe cases)
*   Refer to hospital (See box)

### WHEN CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVE DIAGNOSIS OF 
PERSISTENT DIARRHEA AND DYSENTRY
*   Danger signs (return immediately)
*   Passing many watery stools
*   Repeated vomitings / very thirsty
*   Eating / drinking poorly
*   Develops fever / blood in stools
