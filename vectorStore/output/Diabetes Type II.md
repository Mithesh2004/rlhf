## DIAGNOSIS
*   FPG ≥126 mg/dl (after 8hr fasting)
    OR
*   2-h plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dl during OGTT
    OR
*   HbA1C ≥ 6.5%
    OR
*   Diabetes symptoms + random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl

## PREDIABETES:
Impaired fasting glucose: FPG 100-125 mg/dL; Impaired glucose tolerance: 140-199 mg/dL; HbA1c 5.7-6.4%

## ASSESS

*   CO-MORBIDITIES: **Hypertension**, **Dyslipidaemia**, **CAD**, **CKD**
*   EXAMINATION: **BMI waist circumference**, **BP Peripheral pulses**, **Pin-prick sensation, monofilament test, vibration, DTR**, **Skin, oral cavity, foot examination**, **Fundus (dilated) examination**

## INVESTIGATION
*   HbA1c
*   Creatinine
*   K+
*   Fasting lipid profile
*   Urine routine examination and spot albumin: creatinine ratio#
*   LFT/ALT, AST
*   ECG
*   Others like Echo, USG abdomen as indicated
*   #These may best be carried out after initial glycaemic control

## TREATMENT
*   Dietary modification
*   Avoidance of tobacco and restriction/ avoidance of alcohol
*   Physical activity
*   Pharmacotherapy:
    *   HbA1c < 8.5%: Monotherapy- Metformin
    *   HbA1c 8.5-10%: Dual therapy- Metformin + SU's/TZD/DPPIVI/SGLT2i/AGI/GLP-1RA
    *   HbA1c > 10%: Basal Insulin+ Metformin + another OAD / triple OAD combination

## MONITORING
*   Blood glucose; FPG and 2 hours PPG once monthly more frequent as required including SMBG or CGM
*   HbAlc every 6-12 months (3 monthly if uncontrolled)
*   Annual monitoring : ECG, urine ACR (albumin creatinine ratio), dilated fundoscopy,foot examination

## METABOLIC TARGETS
*   HbA1c </= 7.0% (except elderly and those with significant comorbid conditions) where higher target may be acceptable
*   Pre-prandial capillary plasma glucose: 80-130 mg/dl
*   Post-prandial capillary plasma glucose: <180 mg/dl
*   BP=140/90 (130/80 in CKD) LDL: < 100 mg/dl (< 70mg/dl in CAD)

## REFERRALS
*   Endocrinology: for uncontrolled hyperglycemia
*   Ophthalmology: at initial evaluation and every year
*   Nephrology: for deranged renal function
*   Cardiology: for CAD/HF/arrhythmia

## SCREENING FOR DIABETES MELLITUS

### IN AN APPARENTLY NORMAL ADULT
*   In obese or overweight (BMI ≥ 27.5 or ≥ 23 kg/m²) with any of the following risk factors
    *   First degree relative with diabetes
    *   History of cardiovascular disease
    *   BP (≥ 140/90 mmHg)
    *   Dyslipidemia (TG > 250 mg/dL, HDL <40 mg/dl in male, <50 mg/dl in female
    *   Physical inactivity
    *   Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
    *   Insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans)
    *   Adults > 30 years of age
    *   Previous history of GDM

### IN AN ADULT WITH ILLNESS
*   In any adult/adolescent who presents with one of the following illness/complaints
    *   Osmotic symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, nocturia)
    *   Unexplained weight loss
    *   Unexplained depression or dementia
    *   Acute coronary syndrome
    *   Deep seated infections (liver abscess, lower lobe pneumonia, tuberculosis, pyelonephritis, abscesses, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis)
    *   Recurrent infections (tinea, oral thrush, onychomycosis, cystitis-urinary tract infection, sinusitis, STI, cellulitis, carbuncle)
    *   Non-healing ulcers (foot ulcers-infected/neuropathic)
    *   Exogenous/iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome

### IN PREGNANCY
*   H/O GDM/Pre-existing diabetes
*   All pregnant women to be screened in 1st trimester with FPG
*   FPG ≥ 126 and/or HbAlc ≥ 6.5% to be considered pre-existing diabetes
*   FPG between 92-125 to be considered as GDM
*   All those women with normal screening in 1st trimester to get a 75 g-oral glucose tolerance test done at 24-28 weeks
*   All GDM women to be tested 6 weeks post-partum and once every 3 years
*   PREDIABETES: should be tested yearly
