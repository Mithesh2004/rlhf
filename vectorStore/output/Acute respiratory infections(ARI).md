# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for Management of **ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION IN ADULTS**
ICD-10-309-J18; J00-06; J40

## WHEN TO SUSPECT

## SYMPTOMS
*   Cough with yellow/rusty sputum
*   Breathlessness
*   Pleuritic chest pain
*   Malaise, myalgia, arthralgia
*   Extra pulmonary symptoms

## PAST HISTORY
*   TB
*   Pneumonia
*   Airway disease
*   Bronchiectasis
*   Diabetes
*   Chronic steroid use

## CLINICAL EXAMINATION
1.  **Vital parameters:**
    *   Sensorium, Pulse, Blood pressure, Respiratory rate, Temperature, Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry

2.  **Systemic examination:**
    *   a. Upper respiratory tract: nose & paranasal sinuses (frontal and maxillary sinus tenderness), throat examination (pharynx and tonsils)
    *   b. Lower respiratory tract: breath sounds (type, intensity), added sounds (crackles, wheeze, pleural rub)

**Signs of respiratory failure:** RR> 30/min, Abdomino-thoracic paradox, cyanosis, speaks in short sentences. Refer Respiratory Failure STW.

Frank haemoptysis, may suggest **Pulmonary TB or malignancy**

*   Fever, tachycardia, pharyngitis, suffusion of eyes, rhinitis, hoarse voice
*   Respiratory system examination: Normal

## PROCEED FOR FURTHER ASSESSMENT
*   Fever, tachycardia
*   Respiratory system exam: Wheeze
    *   Consider acute exacerbation of asthma/COPD if there is a history of any of these 2 illnesses

*   Fever, tachycardia, tachypnea
*   Respiratory system exam: Crackles/bronchial breath sounds
    *   Consider acute exacerbation of asthma/COPD is there is a history of any of these 2 illnesses

## PATHWAYS BASED ON INITIAL ASSESSMENT FINDINGS
### PATHWAY 1: **ACUTE URI (RESPIRATORY CATARRH)**
**LABORATORY INVESTIGATION:**
*   Total and differential count in suspected flu.

**TREATMENT**
*   Symptomatic treatment for fever, myalgia (**Paracetamol** or other **NSAID**),
*   Rest, Oral fluids (plenty)
*   Oral antihistamines (Tab. **CPM** 4mg BD) for severe runny nose or sneezing
*   Antibiotics in acute follicular tonsillitis:
    *   **Amoxicillin/Ampicillin** 500mg tid X 5 days
    *   In penicillin sensitive individuals: **Erythromycin estolate** 250mg q 6 hrly X 5 days with food
*   Suspect epidemic flu
    *   H/o recent travel, symptoms of upper respiratory infection, diarrhoea, myalgia, breathlessness Refer to higher centre for diagnosis, notification and treatment.

### PATHWAY 2: **ACUTE BRONCHITIS**
**LABORATORY INVESTIGATION:**
*   Total and differential count if sputum is purulent
*   X-ray chest PA view

**TREATMENT**
*   Symptomatic treatment for fever (**Paracetamol** or other **NSAID**), Oral fluids (plenty)
*   Inhaled bronchodilators: **Salbutamol** nebulization (5mg/2.5ml) 6-8 hourly
*   Antibiotics if there is purulent sputum and polymorphonuclear leukocytosis
    *   **Amoxicillin** 500mg tidX 5 days
    *   In penicillin sensitive individuals: **Erythromycin estolate** 250mg q 6 hrly X5 days with food
*   If asthma is suspected refer to asthma STW

### PATHWAY 3: **COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA**
**SEVERITY ASSESSMENT**
*   X-ray
*   Use **CRB-65** score for mortality risk assessment in primary care

**CRB-65 SCORE**

| SCORE | RISK CLASS    | SITE OF CARE |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 0     | Low Risk      | OP           |
| 1-2   | Intermediate Risk | IP           |
| 3-4   | High Risk     | ICU          |

*65 in the scoring mnemonic refers to age> 65
Give 1 point for each of the following Prognostic features:

*   Confusion
*   Respiratory rate ≥30/ min
*   Low BP (DBP ≤60 mm Hg or SBP ≤90 mm Hg)
*   Age ≥65 years

## OUT-PATIENT BASED CARE OF CAP (CRB-65 SCORE 0-1)
### INVESTIGATIONS
*   Preliminary
    *   Chest radiogram
    *   Repeat if:
        *   i. Patient is not improving/worsening clinically
        *   ii. Suspected underlying malignancy
*   Desirable
    *   1. Pulse oximetry in outpatients
    *   2. Sputum microbiology: In suspected PTB & non-response after 48 hours of antibiotics

### TREATMENT
1.  Targeted towards **Streptococcus pneumoniae**
2.  Oral antibiotics after checking for comorbidities* (Diabetes, CVDs, CKD, CLD, Hepatic Pathology, Cancer, Alcohol Abuse, H/o antibiotics within last 3 months.)
    *   a. Without comorbidities: Cap. **Amoxicillin** (500 mg TDS)/Tab. **Erythromycin** 250mg QID/Tab. **Doxycycline** 100mg BD
    *   b. With comorbidities: Cap. **Amoxicillin** 500mg TDS + Tab.**Azithromycin** 500 mg OD
3.  Duration: 5 days in (A); extend to a 7-10 days course if there is no response within 3 days of starting treatment and in (B).
4.  Do not give:
    *   a. **Corticosteroids**: unless other medical indications present
    *   b. **Fluoroquinolones**: as they have anti-tubercular activity.

## INPATIENT MANAGEMENT OF CAP
### ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY IN THE HOSPITALIZED NON-ICU SETTING
*   a. Single agent IV β-lactam
*   b. If suspected atypical pathogens, other end organ disease, diabetes, malignancy, severe CAP, use of antibiotics in past 3 months: Combination of IV β-lactam (**Cefotaxime** 2 grams TID/IV **Ceftriaxone** 1gram BD/**Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid** 1.2 grams TID) + ORAL macrolide (Tab **Azithromycin** 500 mg PO OD/Tab **Clarithromycin** 500 mg PO BD)

### ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY IN THE HOSPITALIZED ICU SETTING
*   i. Patients without risk factors for **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**: Manage as above
*   ii. Suspected **P. aeruginosa** (diabetes, chronic lung disease like bronchiectasis, chronic steroid therapy):
    *   IV **Cefepime** (IG BD)/IV **Ceftazidime** (2G TID)/ **Piperacillin-tazobactam** (4.5 G QID)/ IV **Cefoperazone-sulbactam** 1.5G IV TID/IV **Meropenem** 1g TID;
    *   Combination therapy: Aminoglycosides (IV **Amikacin**)/Antipseudomonal fluoroquinolones (**Levofloxacin/Moxifloxacin**)

### ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CAP
*   a. Steroids are not recommended for use in non-severe CAP
*   b. Non-invasive ventilation may be used in patients with CAP and acute respiratory failure

#### CONTRA INDICATIONS FOR NON-INVASIVE VENTILATION
*   a. Cardiorespiratory arrest
*   b. Presence of severe upper airway inflammation & edema
*   c. Severe haemodynamic instability - hypotension
*   d. Eu-capnic (normal PaCO2) coma
*   e. Multiple organ dysfunction or severe psychomotor agitation

### DISCHARGE CRITERIA
*   Accepting orally, Afebrile and Hemodynamically stable for a period of at least 48 h

## REFERRAL TO A HIGHER CENTRE: CLINICAL CRITERIA
1.  Frank hemoptysis and/or Signs of respiratory failure [listed under in the history and evaluation sections]
2.  CRB-65 score >1
3.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry ≤ 92% (patients ≤ 50 yrs) OR <90% (patients > 50 yrs)
4.  Multi-lobar consolidation on chest X-ray
5.  Confusion/disorientation
6.  Hypothermia (core temperature<360C)

## POINTS TO NOTE WHILE SHIFTING
1.  If referring to a higher center, give the first dose of antibiotic (oral and if available, parenteral), secure an IV line and start 0.9% Normal saline and oxygen supplementation through face mask at 4-6 litres per minute during shift
2.  If the patient is drowsy, has copious secretions, consider calling for help from the SUB-DISTRICT/DISTRICT hospital for endotracheal intubation and shifting on a transport ventilator

## KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES
