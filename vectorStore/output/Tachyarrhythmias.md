# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## TACHYARRHYTHMIA
ICD-10-P29.11

### SUSPECTING TACHYARRHYTHMIA SYMPTOMS
*   Palpitations/chest discomfort
*   Parents may report increased precordial activity or observe neck pulsations
*   Unexplained lethargy
*   Syncope/presyncope: Relatively rare in children but potentially serious

### SIGNS
*   Tachycardia out of proportion to clinical condition
*   Irregular heart rate
*   Unexplained heart failure

### KEY QUESTIONS
*   Is there **hemodynamic instability**?
*   Can the heart rate be explained by clinical condition (Fever etc.)
*   Is the arrhythmia incessant or episodic?
*   Is there an underlying **structural heart disease**?
*   Is this a re-entrant arrhythmia or does it involve an automatic focus?

## MANAGEMENT

### Hemodynamic Stability

#### Stable
Common
Stable/minimally distressed
Good perfusion

#### Unstable
Uncommon
Distressed
In shock
Poor perfusion; pulse not felt
Connect to Defibrillator paddles

#### Narrow QRS tachycardia
![Narrow QRS tachycardia]

#### Regular Wide QRS tachycardia
![Regular Wide QRS tachycardia]

#### Irregular Wide QRS tachycardia
![Irregular Wide QRS tachycardia]

#### Synchronized Cardioversion 1J/Kg
![Synchronized Cardioversion 1J/Kg]

#### Defibrillation 2 J./Kg
![Defibrillation 2 J./Kg]

Obtain
1.  12 lead ECG; Limb leads alone if child does not cooperate (If ECG machine is unavailable, a video recording of the monitor must be obtained)
2.  Reliable I/V access; Proximal sites preferred

![Undiluted Saline bolus, fast 5-10 push CC]
Central line, ideally
Brachial line enough in small children

Adenosine 100-200 mcg/kg, fast push Max 0.3mg/kg

Adenosine administration

### REGULAR TACHYCARDIA

#### Sinus tachycardia suggested by:
*   Heart rates <220 -age
*   Subtle variations in rates
*   Associated fever/systemic illness other conditions
*   Bronchodilators/ Adrenaline nebulization
*   Normal p prior to every QRS

#### Tachyarrhythmia suggested by:
*   Fixed rates often >220 -age
*   Tachycardia not explained by clinical condition
*   Abnormal ECG (p waves not clearly seen or different from sinus rhythm or dissociated)
*   Adenosine administration with ECG record is often diagnostic

Obtaining ECG during arrhythmia is of great value as it enables precise diagnosis and treatment. All efforts must be made to document the tachyarrhythmia and it's response to treatment

### Adenosine

![Sudden termination]
Re-entrant supraventricular tachycardia

![No effect]
Sinus tachycardia, Junctional ectopic tachycardia, EAT

![Slow and unmask]
Atrial Flutter, ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT)

![Defibrillation]
VE Ventricular fibrillation

Defibrillation shock
Sinus rhythm

0.5-2 J/Kg synchronized for suspected SVT/VT
2-4 J/Kg for VF; should not be synchronized

### Adenosine
*   Proximal access
*   Connect three-way to I/V port
*   Adenosine **100-200 mcg/Kg** rapid I/V push followed immediately by **5-10 ml** saline bolus
*   Always record Electrocardiogram (ECG) during administration
*   Always record Electrocardiogram (ECG) after treating the arrhythmia also

![12 lead ECG recorded after termination of the tachycardia showing a clear substrate in the form of pre-excitation]
12 lead ECG recorded after termination of the tachycardia showing a clear substrate in the form of pre-excitation

### ABBREVATIONS
EAT: Ectopic Atrial Tachycardia
SVT: Supraventricular Tachycardia
VT: Ventricular Tachycardia
