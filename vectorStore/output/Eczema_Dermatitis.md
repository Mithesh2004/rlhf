# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
ECZEMA/ DERMATITIS
ICD-10-L20

## MAJOR FORMS OF ECZEMA

### ACUTE
Red, edematous plaques with
small, grouped vesicles

### SUBACUTE
Erythematous plaques with
scaling or crusting

### CHRONIC
Lesions may have scaling or
lichenification

### EXOGENOUS ECZEMAS
Those with a known exogenous
trigger, management of
exogenous eczemas is to remove
the cause if possible, along with
pharmacological intervention
*   Allergic contact eczema
*   Dermatophytide
*   Eczematous polymorphic light
    eruption
*   Infective eczema
*   Irritant contact eczema
*   Photoallergic contact eczema
*   Post-traumatic eczema

### ENDOGENOUS ECZEMAS
Without a known exogenous trigger,
more often requires pharmacological
intervention
*   Asteatotic eczema
*   **Atopic eczema**
*   Chronic superficial scaly eczema
*   Eyelid eczema
*   Hand eczema
*   Juvenile plantar dermatosis
*   Nummular eczema
*   Pityriasis alba
*   Eczema associated with systemic
    disease
*   Seborrhoeic eczema
*   Venous eczema

## HISTORY
*   Associated history of **atopy**, allergic rhinitis or asthma in patient and family members
*   Age of onset is usually early(less than 5 years) in **atopic dermatitis**
*   Site of onset- predominant flexural involvement in **atopic dermatitis**
*   Possible allergens implicated
*   High risk occupations with increased exposure to allergens or irritants such as agricultural work, masons,
    hair-dressers etc.
*   Associated photosensitivity, especially in parthenium dermatitis
*   Change in severity with season; summer exacerbation in parthenium dermatitis
*   Winter exacerbation in **atopic dermatitis**

## EXAMINATION

### ATOPIC DERMATITIS
*   Infantile: Most commonly on the face, followed by involvement of extensors of the knees and elbows
*   Childhood/ Adult phase: Pattern changes to flexural involvement (cubital and popliteal fossa)

### ENDOGENOUS ECZEMA
*   **Nummular dermatitis/eczematous:** Circular or oval, commonly affecting neck, hands and feet
*   **Seborrhoeic dermatitis:** Involvement of the scalp and other seborrhoeic areas and skin folds; ranging from mild flaking to thicker, yellow, greasy scales and crusts
*   **Venous eczema:** Eczema affecting the medial aspect of ankles associated with varicose veins/venous incompetence

### CONTACT DERMATITIS
*   It can be irritant or allergic
*   Eczema pattern corresponds to the pattern of allergen/ irritant exposure
*   It can be localized or widespread
EXAMPLE:
*   Parthenium dermatitis contact
*   dermatitis to nickel contact
*   dermatitis to hair dye

## DIAGNOSIS
*   Most cases of eczema can be diagnosed clinically
*   Secondary infection is common, may cause eczema to flare and can be confirmed by taking swabs for culture
    and sensitivity
*   Patch tests are designed to detect allergens in cases of suspected allergic contact dermatitis
*   Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or biopsy when dermatophyte infection or other diagnoses are
    suspected

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
*   Tinea corporis
*   Psoriasis
*   Cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (CTCL)

## TREATMENT

### GENERAL PRINCIPLES
*   Avoidance of allergens and irritant materials
*   Daily bath with mild soap, keep nails short, avoid
    scratching
*   Moisturizer are cornerstone in the management of
    eczema; to be applied immediately after bathing
    while the skin is still damp and apply multiple times
    during the day
*   Antihistamines for (eg. levocetirizine) for control of
    pruritus
*   Topical corticosteroids (TCS) mild – Over face/
    flexures genitals. Mid potent TCS over palms, soles
    and lichenified lesions
*   Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs)- Face/flexures
    genitals and/or as maintenance treatment
*   If secondary infection (pain, pus discharge, yellow
    crust)- Treat with topical/ oral antibiotic as needed

### SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT
**Primary/Secondary Level**
*   Treatment of active eczema: Daily use of TCS of appropriate
    strength until completely clear + antihistamine (for
    sedative/antipruritic effects) ± oral antibiotic course (if
    superinfection) - (refer to STW on rational use of topical
    therapy)
*   Maintenance treatment for area where lesions are more
    resistant to treatment or there is propensity for relapse, like
    flexural skin- Intermittent use of mid-potency TCS (e.g. 2-3
    days/week) and/or TCI (e.g. 3-5 days/week)

**Tertiary Level**
*   Severe disease in addition to above may require
    phototherapy or systemic treatment (Short course of oral
    corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine etc.)

**AVOIDANCE OF PROVOKING AGENTS, MOISTURIZERS AND EARLY TREATMENT ARE THE AIM OF ECZEMA MANAGEMENT**
