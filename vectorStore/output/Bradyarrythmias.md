# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**BRADYARRHYMIAS** IN SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS
ICD-10-R00.1

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[WHEN TO SUSPECT
    Patient with
    any of the
    following
    symptoms,
    AND a pulse
    rate < 50bpm:
    (persistent)] --> B(Syncope/ presyncope/ dizziness)
    A --> C(Lethargy/fatigue)
    A --> D(Breathlessness/ chest pain on
    exertion)
```

## BASIC EVALUATION
### HISTORY
*   Syncope/ presyncope: frequency, associated fall/ injury/incontinence
*   Exertional angina or known **coronary artery disease**
*   Known **hypothyroidism** or **kidney disease**
*   On **beta-blockers**, **Calcium Channel Blockers** or **digoxin**
*   Patient with an implanted **pacemaker** or other device
*   **Yellow oleander poisoning**

### EXAMINATION
*   Drowsiness/impaired
    consciousness
*   BP, heart rate

### TESTS TO BE DONE
Patient presenting to PHC/CHC:
*   12-lead ECG
*   Blood urea, serum creatinine
*   Electrolytes
*   Blood sugar

## EVALUATION AND TREATMENT OF UNSTABLE PATIENTS
1.  TREATMENT OF ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS
    *   **Hyperkalemia**
    *   Suspected drug (BB or CCB) overdose:
        i. Withhold the drug
        ii. iv insulin (1 U/kg bolus followed by 0.5 U/kg/h) with glucose monitoring(or) iv
        glucagon if available
2.  TEMPORARY PACEMAKER INSERTION
    (iv dopamine or adrenaline may be given till the time TPI can be placed)

## EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF STABLE PATIENTS
Findings on 12-lead ECG
*   Atrioventricular block
*   Sinus node dysfunction
*   Other conduction disorders with 1:1
    AV conduction
*   Non-diagnostic ECG

### INDICATIONS FOR URGENT TREATMENT/REFERRAL
*   **Hypotension** (SBP <90 mmHg), impaired consciousness or
    ongoing chest pain
*   Recurrent or ongoing **syncope/presyncope**
*   Associated headache with or without neurologic deficit (suspect
    intracranial event)
*   Patient with a pre-existing device
*   If ECG available, evidence of any of the following
    *   Complete heart block
    *   **Sinus node disease** with pauses >3 s long
    *   **Bradycardia** (HR < 50 bpm)
    (with or without **hyperkalemia**, serum K > 5 mEq/L)

### GENERAL APPROACH TO PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC BRADYCARDIA
1.  Rule out associated conditions
    *   Renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia
    *   Drug toxicity (BB, CCB, clonidine, Lithium)
    *   Sleep apnea (clinical scoring systems such as Epworth
        Sleepiness Scale may be used for initial assessment)
2.  Transthoracic echocardiography

## INDICATIONS FOR PERMANENT PACING
### AV NODAL DISEASE
*   Complete heart block, advanced AV block,
    or Mobitz Type II block
*   Symptomatic patients with AV block other
    than above
*   Associated neuromuscular disease

### SINUS NODE DYSFUNCTION
*   Symptomatic patients with sinus
    pauses > 3 s long with symptom
    correlation
*   Asymptomatic patients with sinus
    pauses > 6 s long

### OTHER CONDUCTION DISORDERS WITH 1:1 AV
CONDUCTION
*   Symptomatic patients with HV ≥70 ms on EPS
*   Others (alternating BBB, infiltrative/ neuromuscular
    disease)

## RECOMMENDED PACING MODES
1.  SND with intact AV conduction
    *   Atrial-based single or dual chamber pacing
        -   VVI pacing is reasonable if symptoms are
            infrequent
2.  AV node disease
    *   VVI/Dual chamber pacing in patients with
        LVEF >50%
    *   CRT (or HBP) in patients with LVEF
        36-50% and requiring ventricular pacing
        >40% of the time

## ADDITIONAL TESTING
1.  Advanced imaging (CMRI) may be needed if infiltrative disease
    is suspected
2.  Ambulatory ECG may be needed
    *   In patients with first or second degree AV block for
        symptom correlation
    *   In patients with suspected sinus node disease for
        detection of pauses and symptom correlation
    *   In symptomatic patients with LBBB or bifascicular block
3.  ICM and EPS (consult published society guidelines)

ECG: SINUS BRADYCARDIA

ECG: THIRD DEGREE HEART BLOCK

are based on expert opinions and available scientific evidence. There may be variations in the management of an individual patient based on his/her specific condition, as decided by
the treating physician. There will be no indemnity for direct or indirect consequences. Kindly visit our web portal (stw.icmr.org.in) for more information.
