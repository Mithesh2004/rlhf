# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**ACUTE RHINOSINUSITIS**
ICD 10 J01.90

## RELATED CLINICAL SCENARIOS

**Recurrent acute sinusitis** is episodes of acute sinusitis interspersed
with symptom free intervals of more than 3 months in duration.

## WHEN TO SUSPECT?

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Usually a sequela of viral infection which causes ciliary impairment and bacterial superinfection] --> B(Diagnosis- persistence of nasal blockage/nasal discharge and facial pain/ hyposmia beyond 7 days (maximum upto 3 months));
```

Symptoms with duration less than 7 days are treated as **viral upper
respiratory infection.**

**Invasive fungal sinusitis** is suspected if in addition to above symptoms
the following are present: facial hyposthesia, facial skin/palatal/ turbinate
discoloration and proptosis/diplopia/ reduced or loss of vision

Children may present with **acute febrile illness/cough**
associated with these symptoms.

## ALTERNATIVE CLINICAL SCENARIOS

*   Consider alternate diagnosis if: Unilateral symptoms/ Bleeding/Crusting/Cacosmia (foul smell)
*   Rule out other contributory factors: Allergy/upper alveolar dental caries/ DNS/LPR/smoking.
*   Rhinorrhoea and nasal congestion in second trimester of pregnancy is considered hormonal in etiology and is to be managed with
    saline irrigation/drops

## RED FLAGS FOR REFERRAL TO DISTRICT HOSPITAL

*   Known **diabetic/ immunocompromised**
*   Suspicion of complications viz. (A) Orbital involvement (Periorbital edema/ erythema, displaced globe,
    ophthalmoplegia, visual disturbance); (B) Meningitis/ altered sensorium; (C) Frontal fullness.
*   Non-resolution with oral antibiotics for ten days
*   Pointers of **invasive fungal sinusitis** (Facial hypoesthesia, facial skin/palatal/turbinate discoloration)

## CLINICAL EXAMINATION

### PRELIMINARY

*   Anterior rhinoscopy: Discharge, bleeding, crusting, polyposis
*   Oral examination: Dental caries, post nasal drip, palatal discolouration
*   Assess for contributory factors listed above

### DESIRABLE

*   Nasal endoscopy

## LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS

Desirable in non-resolving/worsening cases despite antibiotic
therapy

*   Endoscopy- for guided nasal swabs/ KOH smear
*   CT PNS (for suspected complications/non-resolving cases on
    antibiotics for 14 days)
*   Screen for Diabetes / Immunodeficiency

## MANAGEMENT

### PHC / PRIMARY LEVEL

Duration of treatment 7-14 days

*   Oral antibiotics- **Amoxycillin/Coamoxyclav** for 7-10 days. **Levofloxacin** and **Azithromycin** can be
    opted for patients intolerant/ sensitive to penicillins.
*   Topical budesonide/ mometasone nasal spray once/twice a day for 2 weeks provides earlier
*   Normal saline nasal washes help in clearing secretions and improved effect of topical
*   Topical/oral decongestant (Oxymetazline/ pseudoephedrine) for 3-5 days relieves symptoms.
*   Adequate hydration and steam inhation.
*   Antihistaminics (patients with co-existing allergy).

### INDICATIONS OF PARENTERAL ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY

*   Orbital/intracranial
    complications
*   Non-resolution of symptoms
    with atleast 7 days of oral
    antibiotics
*   Worsening of symptoms while
    on oral antibiotics

### DISTRICT HOSPITAL

*   Surgical interventions to manage:
*   Underlying anatomical conditions causing recurrent acute sinusitis like- DNS/ adenoid
    hypertrophy/ anatomical variations seen on CT
*   Ophthalmology referral for suspected intraorbital complications
*   Dental deferral for suspected dental origin infection.
*   Invasive fungal sinusitis- start antifungal medications, control underlying
    immunocompromising co-morbidity and consider debridement.

### TERTIARY LEVEL

Cases of **acute invasive fungal sinusitis**/
**complicated acute bacterial sinusitis**
and patients with
immunocompromised status may be
referred for management.
