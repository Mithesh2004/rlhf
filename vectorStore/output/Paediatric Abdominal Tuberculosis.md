# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**PAEDIATRIC ABDOMINAL TUBERCULOSIS**

## WHEN TO SUSPECT?
*   One or more of following
    *   Recurrent/chronic
        **abdominal pain** in presence
        of **red flag signs**
    *   **Abdominal distension/mass**
    *   **Altered bowel habits**
*   **Constitutional symptoms** like
    *   Presence of **Fever >2 weeks**,
        **Anorexia**, **Unexplained weight
        loss** or **no weight gain** in last 3
        months despite adequate
        nutrition may be present
*   History of contact with **TB**
    patient may also be present

## CLINICAL FEATURES SPECIFIC TO TYPE OF ABDOMINAL TB
ICD-10-A18.31

### PERITONEAL TB
*   **Abdominal pain, distension**
*   **Fever**
*   **Weight loss**

### NODAL TB
*   **Pain abdomen**
*   **Fever**
*   **Palpable abdominal lump**

### INTESTINAL TB
*   **Recurrent intestinal colic**
*   **Altered bowel habits**
*   **Chronic diarrhoea**
*   **Partial/complete intestinal
    obstruction**
*   **Weight loss, anorexia**
*   **Palpable abdominal lump**
*   **Lower gastrointestinal
    bleeding**

### VISCERAL TB (LIVER,
SPLEEN, PANCREAS)
*   **Abdominal pain**
*   **Fever**
*   **Jaundice**
*   **Weight loss**
*   **Anorexia**
*   **Hepatomegaly**
*   **Splenomegaly**
*   **Hepatic abscess**
*   **Palpable
    abdominal lump**
*   **Abnormal LFTs**

## EXAMINATION FINDINGS
*   **Anthropometry**
*   **General physical & systemic
    examination**
*   Look for **peripheral LAP**,
    **ascites**, **hepatosplenomegaly**,
    **doughy feel of abdomen**,
    **palpable abdominal lump**,
    **visible peristalsis** or a **moving
    mass** - "gola" formation due
    to partially obstructed
    dilated bowel loop

### RED FLAGS
*   **Pain abdomen waking child
    from sleep**
*   **Chronic, severe, or nocturnal
    diarrhea**
*   **Presence of constitutional
    symptoms** like **fever**,
    **anorexia**, **weight loss**, etc.
*   **Localized distension or mass**

## INVESTIGATIONS

### ESSENTIAL
*   **Ultrasound abdomen**

#### SUGGESTIVE FINDINGS
*   **Abdominal LN**:
    measuring >15 mm in
    short axis, conglomerate
    and/or central necrosis
*   **Omental/mesenteric
    thickening** >15 mm with
    increased echogenicity
*   **Ileocaecal wall
    thickening**
*   **Chest X Ray**

#### NON SPECIFIC FINDINGS
*   **Intraabdominal fluid**
    (free or loculated) or
    **Inter-loop ascites**
*   **Ascitic fluid** with
    multiple septations
*   **Abdominal LAP** with
    **SAD** <15 mm in
    absence of **red flag
    signs**

### Ascites
#### Essential
*   If exudative ascites, ascitic fluid
    for **NAAT, TB culture**
*   No role of **ADA**

### Enlarged Abdominal mass
#### Desirable
*   **USG** guided **Abdominal
    mass-FNA** for cytology, **NAAT, TB
    culture**

#### Optional
*   **USG/CT** guided core biopsy of **LN**
    for histology, **NAAT, TB culture**

### Intestinal involvement
#### Desirable
*   **CECT Abdomen/CT enterography**
*   **USG guided Abdominal Mass** - **FNA** for
    cytology, **NAAT, culture**

#### Optional
*   **Ileocolonoscopy, tissue biopsy (HPE, NAAT)**
*   **Laparoscopy, tissue biopsy for HPE, NAAT**

*   **sputum/GA/IS (If CXR abnormal)** for **NAAT, TB culture**
*   **Ascitic fluid (If present) for cytology, protein & albumin**
*   **Peripheral LN-FNA (If size >2 cm) for cytology, NAAT, TB
    culture**

## DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM
If abdominal TB suspected

*Consider USG guided FNA from abdominal nodes/refer to higher centre if not available or feasible
#Consider CECT Abdomen/CT enterography if Isolated ileocaecal thickening or LN sampling not
feasible/Refer to higher centre if not available

## TREATMENT
*   Start treatment & follow-up as per **NTEP**
*   **ATT** for 6 months (**2HRZE + 4HRE**)
*   **Pyridoxine supplementation**- **10 mg/day**
*   **Steroids**- Routinely not recommended **(SAIO)**
*   Supportive treatment- Management of
    **SAM/Malnutrition** as per national guidelines
*   **Surgical treatment**:
    *   **Acute intestinal obstruction, Bowel
        perforation**
    *   Persistence of obstructive symptoms
        despite conservative management & **ATT**
*   **DO NOT start Empirical ATT with isolated**:
    *   Recurrent/Chronic abdominal pain without
        red flag signs
    *   Chronic diarrhoea without proper evaluation
    *   Failure to gain weight

## MANAGEMENT
### MONITORING
*   Assessment of response to treatment:
    *   Clinical follow up - every month during
        treatment & after that every 3 months
    *   Radiologically by **USG** - At the end of
        treatment or if worsening or non response to
        treatment
    *   Microbiological - If worsening or non
        response to treatment
*   Pointers towards **DR TB** investigation:
    *   Non response to treatment or Worsening or
        deterioration of constitutional symptoms
        after initial improvement. Rule out Crohn's
        disease OR Inflammatory Bowel Disease
    *   Obstructive symptoms may persist or worsen
        despite treatment with appropriate **ATT**
*   Monitor for
    *   Adherence to treatment (**ATT**)
    *   Adverse drug reactions- **ATT** induced

## WHEN TO REFER?
*   Diagnosis is uncertain &
    additional
    investigations are
    required
*   Acute intestinal
    obstruction or bowel
    perforation
*   **DR TB**
*   No response to
    appropriate treatment
*   Oral drug (**ATT**)
    intolerance/cannot be
    given
