# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of **STABLE ANGINA**
ICD-10-I20.9

PATIENT PRESENTING
WITH CHEST PAIN

## CONSIDER ANGINA IF
*   Diffuse retrosternal pain, heaviness or constriction, radiating to arms or neck or back
*   Associated with sweating
*   Easily reproduced with post-meal exertion
*   Consider atypical presentation: Exertional fatigue or breathlessness or profuse sweating or epigastric discomfort
*   Likelihood more if known patient of CAD

## CATEGORIZE ANGINA
*   **ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME**
    *   Angina at rest or lasting more than 20 minutes
    *   Recent worsening of stable angina (crescendo) to CCS class III
    *   New onset effort angina of less than 1 month in CCS class II/III
    *   Post infarction angina
    *   For management: refer to STEMI/ NSTEMI STW

*   **STABLE ANGINA**
    *   Any effort related pain fitting in previous category, relieved by rest or NTG in 1-2 min

## ANGINA UNLIKELY IF
*   Variable location or characteristic
*   Long lasting (hours to days) or short lasting (less than a minute)
*   Restricted to areas above jaw or below epigastrium
*   Localized to a point
*   Pricking or piercing or stabbing type of pain
*   Precipitated by movement of neck or arms or respiration

## STABLE ANGINA: GENERAL MANAGEMENT
1.  Manage factors potentaiting angina
    *   Anemia, Thyrotoxicosis, Pregnancy, febrille illness
    *   Hypertension, Ventricular hypertrophy, CHF
    *   Tachy or brady-arrhythmia
    *   Drugs: bronchodilators, steroids
2.  Risk factor control
3.  Other atherosclerotic CV disease: PVD, stroke
4.  Secondary prevention : Statins, BB, ACE-I

## INVESTIGATIONS
### ESSENTIAL INVESTIGATIONS
1.  Hemogram
2.  Urea, Creatinine, Electrolytes
3.  Sugar, HbA1C
4.  Lipids
5.  Liver function test
6.  ECG
7.  Plain X-ray chest

### DESIRABLE INVESTIGATIONS
1.  Echocardiography
2.  Exercise Treadmill Test
3.  Thyroid Function Test
4.  Iron profile
5.  Uric acid

### OPTIONAL INVESTIGATIONS
1.  Stress radionuclide/ echocardiographic imaging
2.  CT scan including multi-slice coronary angiography
3.  Coronary Angiography
4.  Coronary Fractional Flow Reserve
5.  Intra-vascular Ultrasound/OCT

## MANAGEMENT

### MANAGEMENT AT PHC/CHC LEVEL
1.  Control angina :
    *   Metoprolol
    *   Add nitrates if symptoms not controlled
2.  ECG for Q waves, ST - T changes, BBB or chamber enlargement
3.  Aspirin & high intensity statins
4.  Refer to higher centre electively

### MANAGEMENT AT DISTRICT HOSPITAL LEVEL
1.  Optimise anti-anginal treatment
2.  Echocardiography for LV function or structural heart disease
3.  Risk stratify by exercise treadmill test in low, intermediate or high risk (DUKE risk score) for cardio-vascular events, if patient is ambulatory and ECG is interpretable
4.  Refer to tertiary centres if:
    *   Angina uncontrolled on optimal medical therapy
    *   Echo reveals abnormality
    *   Non-ambulatory patient or un-interpretable ECG
    *   High risk on exercise stress test for possible re-vascularization

### MANAGEMENT AT TERTIARY LEVEL
1.  Reassess and optimise drug therapy: If uncontrolled choose from trimetazidine, nicorandil ranolazine and ivabid
2.  Risk stratify with exercise treadmill test if not already done
3.  Stress imaging if following:
    *   Non ambulatory patient
    *   Abnormal or uninterpretable baseline ECG
    *   Exercise treadmill test result is equivocal
    *   Compromised LV function

## RISK CATEGORIZATION
Based on clinical features, GRACE score & TIMI score

*   A. Very high:
    *   -Acute LVF
    *   -Hypotension
    *   -Uncontrolled Ventricular arrhythmia
    *   -Severe MR
*   B. High Risk:
    *   -GRACE score > 140 or TIMI score >4
*   C. Intermediate Risk:
    *   -GRACE score 109-140 or TIMI score 2-3
*   D. Low Risk:
    *   -Grace score <108 or TIMI score 0-1

## RISK CATEGORY MANAGEMENT

### Low/Intermediate Risk Group
1.  Optimal anti-anginal therapy
2.  Follow up 3-6 monthly at primary/ secondary care centre
3.  Refer to tertiary centre when change in symptomatic status

### High Risk Group
1.  Discuss pros and cons of possible revascularization and dual anti-platelet therapy
2.  Angiography, if any of following
    *   Angina not controlled on optimal medical therapy
    *   High risk on non-invasive testing
    *   Cardiac arrest survivor or documented VT

## REVASCULARIZATION
1.  Revascularize if anatomy is suitable
2.  Prefer CABG over PCI in DM with multivessel disease or left main disease
3.  Complete re-vascularization is preferable
4.  Use invasive functional and imaging modalities (FFR, IVUS, OCT) when indicated
5.  Stress on continuing dual anti-platelets (aspirin and clopidogrel) after PCI

## DRUGS & DOSAGE

### Anti-platelets
1.  Aspirin 75 mg OD
2.  Clopidogrel 75 mg OD (if intolerant to aspirin)

### Statins:
*   Atorvastatin: 40-80 mg OD
*   Rosuvastatin: 20-40 mg OD

### Ace-inhibitor
*   Ramipril: 2.5-10 mg OD
*   Enalapril: 2.5-10 mg BD

### Anti-ischemic:
1.  Metoprolol:
    *   Short acting: 25-100 mg BD
    *   Long acting: 25-100 mg OD
2.  Nitrates:
    *   Isosorbide mono-nitare: 20 to 60 mg in 2 devided dose
    *   Nitroglycerine sustained release: 2.6 to 6.5 mg BD
3.  Calcium channel blockers:
    *   Verapamil 40-80 mg TDS
    *   Diltiazem 30 to 90 mg TDS
4.  Nicorandil: 5-10 mg BD
5.  Ranolazine: 500-1000 mg BD
6.  Trimetazidine: 20 mg mg TDS

KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES: STRENGTHEN SECONDARY PREVENTION WITH STATINS, BB & ACE-I
