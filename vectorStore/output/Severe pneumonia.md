# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**SEVERE PNEUMONIA IN CHILDREN**
ICD10-J18.9

## PRESENTING SYMPTOMS /WHEN TO SUSPECT?

### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CHECK FOR HISTORY OF
*   Cough, cold, with or without fever, **diculty in breathing** (that includes **fast breathing** and **chest indrawing**) of less than 2 weeks duration.

*   Similar illness in past, if yes, history of improvement with nebulized medications to consider **asthma**.

*   **Asthma/allergy** in family.

*   **GENERAL DANGER SIGNS**
    Not able to drink, persistent vomiting, convulsions, lethargic or unconscious, **stridor** in a calm child or **severe malnutrition**.

*   Influenza like illness in family over past 2 weeks: to consider treatment for influenza.

*   Immunization (age appropriate specifically vaccination included in national schedule and Pneumococcus, Influenza).

*   **SUSPICION OF FOREIGN BODY ASPIRATION**
    Sudden onset choking and breathlessness.

## EXAMINATION FOR FOLLOWING SIGNS

*   **Chest indrawing**, state of alertness, **cyanosis, clubbing, stridor, grunting**.

*   **VITAL SIGNS**
    Respiratory rates, heart rate, temperature, capillary refill time, pulse oximetry.

*   **NUTRITIONAL STATUS**
    Specifically for defining **Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)**.

*   **AUSCULTATION OF CHEST**
    Breath sounds, crepitation, rhonchi.

## DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM
Child age 2–59 months with cough and/or dicult breathing.

*   **RED FLAG SIGNS**
Irregular or gasping respiration, cold extremities, altered sensorium, cyanosis.

*   **NO PNEUMONIA**
    *   Cough and cold, no breathing diculty.
    *   Home care advice.

*   **PNEUMONIA**
    *   Fast breathing (2-12 months >50; 1-5 years>40; >5 years >20 ) and/or chest indrawing oxygen saturation>92%.
    *   Ambulatory treatment with oral **Amoxicillin** and follow up.

*   **SEVERE PNEUMONIA**
    *   Fast breathing (2-12months>50; 1-5 years>40 ;>5 years >20 ) and/or chest indrawing with any of the general danger signs (not able to drink, persistent vomiting, convulsions, lethargic or unconscious, stridor in a calm child or severe malnutrition).
    *   Red flag signs positive Admit or refer to facility with following: Appropriate: ventilation facility, ICU, round the clock monitoring If plan to refer: Give first dose of antibiotics, arrange transport and inform to the referral centre.

## TREATMENT
*   **OXYGEN INHALATION:** by mask (1-2 L/min) or hood (4-6 L/Minute) to maintain oxygen saturation> 95%.
*   **IV ANTIBIOTICS:**
    *   For children 2-59 months: **Ampicillin** 100-200mg/kg in four divided doses + **Gentamicin** 5-7.5 mg/kg as single dose daily.
    *   For children >5 years: **Ampicillin/Amoxicillin**, add macrolide (Azythromycin/Erythromycin) if atypical pneumonia is suspected.
    *   If suspected Staphylococcal pneumonia in any age (Pneumatocele on CXR, post measles, infected scabies or pyoderma) add **Cloxacillin/ Amoxiclavulanic acid**.
*   **SUPPORTIVE CARE:** Paracetamol for fever, IV fluid, bronchodilators (inhaled) as needed.
*   **WHEN AND WHAT TO SWITCH TO ORAL AND DURATION:**
    *   Child is afebrile, RR has returned to below age specific cutoffs, no chest indrawing and accepting orally: switch to oral Amoxicillin to complete a total of 5-7 days duration (include duration of IV also in it).
    *   If getting Doxacillin/Amoxyclav: continue oral Cloxacillin or Amoxclav for 2 weeks.
    *   Start feeding as soon as possible when child shows improvement. IF ASSOCIATED SAM: follow treatment guidelines for SAM.

## INVESTIGATIONS
*   **ESSENTIAL:** Hemogram, random blood sugar, CRP, chest X-ray.
*   **DESIRABLE:** Blood culture, pleural tap, serum electrolytes, renal and liver function tests.
*   **OPTIONAL:** ABG, lung ultrasound, PCT, tracheal aspirate (gram stain with culture), bronchoscopy/BAL, microbiology culture, investigations for atypical organisms, PCR for viral etiology.

## COMPLICATIONS AND THEIR TREATMENT
*   **NON RESPONDERS:** persistence of symptoms and/or signs 48-72 hours after initiation of appropriate treatment-change antimicrobials.
*   **PLEURAL EFFUSION:** diagnostic aspiration.
*   **EMPYEMA:** drainage with ICD.
*   **LUNG ABSCESS:** change antibiotics for longer duration (4-6 weeks).
*   **PNEUMOTHORAX:** Intercostal drainage.
*   **RESPIRATORY FAILURE:** consider ventilation.
*   **INFECTION IN OTHER SITES:** identify and treat appropriately.

### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
*   First and second line antibiotics for severe pneumonia:

    |           | FIRST LINE    | ALTERNATE FIRST LINE | SECOND LINE                         |
    | :-------- | :------------ | :------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
    |           | **Ampicillin** | First gen Cephalosporins     | **Amoxiclav** **Cefuroxime**    **Cefotaxime/Ceftrioxone** |

*   WHEN TO REFER TO HIGHER CENTERS?
Facilities (as described above) for treatment or complications (if develops) are not available, suspecting chronic respiratory problems.
*   WHEN TO SUSPECT INFECTION WITH H1N1 VIRUS?
Child with cold, cough, fever with similar illness in any family members, consider H1N1 infection. Start Oseltamivir (as per national guideline).
*   WHEN TO SUSPECT ACUTE BRONCHIOLITIS?
A child below 2 years of age fulfilling case definition of first episode of severe pneumonia with predominant finding of wheezing on auscultation.
*   WHEN TO SUSPECT ASTHMA?
A child of age >3 years with history of recurrent cough, cold, wheezing with or without fever with good response to bronchodilator and personal or family history of asthma.
*   WHEN TO SUSPECT CHRONIC RESPIRATORY PROBLEM?
Child has any of the following: severe malnutrition, clubbing, feeding diculty, family history of sibling death due to pneumonia, multi site infections (diarrhea, ear discharge oral thrush).

*   Discharge when child is switched to oral medications, accepting oral for 24 to 48 hours
