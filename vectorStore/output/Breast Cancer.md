# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for
**BREAST CANCER**
ICD-10-C 50

## SYMPTOMS
A. Asymmetry of breast or
nipple areola or axilla
B. Breast lump, bulge, blood
vessels prominent
C. Colour change of skin or
nipple areola
D. Deformed breast / nipple
areola (nipple retraction),
dimpling of skin,
Discharge from nipple,
Direct spread-skin (satellite
nodule, ulcer, skin
oedema), chest wall
Distant spread - headache,
jaundice, dyspnoea, bone
pains, ascites

## SIGNS
Evaluation and management by multidisciplinary
team (MDT) of oncology experts
A Breast changes
• Asymmetry in
shape/size of breast or
nipple areola complex
• Breast lump
• Nipple retraction/ulcer
• Change in skin -
puckering, dimpling,
thickening, ulcer,
redness, edema &
satellite nodules
• Fixity to underlying
muscles or chest wall
B Lymph node
• lymph node(s) in axilla
or supra-clavicular fossa
C Systemic changes
• Enlarged liver, ascites,
bony tenderness,
dyspnoea, pleural
effusion

## WORK UP OF A PATIENT WITH SUSPECTED BREAST
**CANCER-TRIPLE ASSESSMENT**
### CLINICAL BREAST EXAMINATION
### IMAGING
*   Bilateral **mammogram**: for women >30 years
*   **Ultrasound**: breast and axilla
*   **MRI** breast in selected cases

### STAGING-T1, T2 No N1
*   Upto Stage 2A no metastatic work up
*   Stage 2B upwards
    *   Chest radiograph
    *   Ultrasound whole abdomen
    *   Bone scan
    *   CECT chest and abdomen
    *   PET-CT (optional)
### PATHOLOGY
*   Core needle biopsy (preferred) for type, grade,
    ER, PR, HER2/neu, Ki-67
*   FISH test if HER-2/neu on IHC-2+/equivocal

## DO NOT
*   Ignore any lump or changes in breast & nipple areola complex
*   Perform excision biopsy for diagnosis
*   Perform FNAC or core needle biopsy before imaging.

## MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE
MANAGEMENT OF BREAST CANCER
Triple assessment (CBE, USG breast and axilla, mammography and core biopsy

```
### ADJUVANT THERAPY (AT)
*   Chemotherapy
    *   Consider for all patients with pT > 1 cm or node positive disease
        based on ER/PR/HER2/Ki-67
*   Radiotherapy
    *   After breast conservation surgery
    *   After mastectomy with node-positive disease or pathological
        T3/T4
*   Targeted therapy
    *   All HER-2/neu positive (3+) or FISH HER-2 amplified patients
        should receive trastuzumab for 12 months
    *   Shorter schedules: 9 weeks to 6 months acceptable in some
        patients
*   Hormone therapy
    *   All ER and/or PR positive cases
    *   For premenopausal women tamoxifen and for post menopausal
        women tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors are appropriate
    *   Minimum for 5 years, if high risk of recurrence like node positive,
        consider for up to 10 years
    *   If AT is used zolendronic acid or other bisphosphonates can be
        added
*   Sequential single agents preferred over combinations when
    possible

## Metastatic Breast Cancer
* Consider - tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, fulvestrant, megesterol acetate, CDK 4/6 inhibitors, everolimus
Ovarian suppression indicated in premenopausal MBC patients, which can be surgical (bilateral oophorectomy) or radiotherapeutic (ovarian radiation) or medical (GnRH analogues)
* Consider - trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, add trastuzumab-emtansine
All patients with bone metastases should receive a bone modifying agent (e.g zoledronic acid) 4-12 weekly
* It is indicated only for palliation of local tumour symptoms bleeding, fungation, etc
* Insert intercostal drainage tube for malignant pleural effusion and chemical pleurodesis with talcum powder or bleomycin
Most effective method for pain relief in bone metastasis

* Is routinely used for brain metastasis: Hemostatic RT used for bleeding ulcer
Pain control and palliative care

ENHANCE AWARENESS AND EARLY DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER BY SCREENING AS PER NATIONAL PROGRAMME
This STW has been prepared by national experts of India with feasibility considerations for various levels of healthcare system in the country. These broad guidelines are advisory, and
are based on expert opinions and available scientific evidence. There may be variations in the management of an individual patient based on his/her specific condition, as decided by
the treating physician. There will be no indemnity for direct or indirect consequences. Kindly visit the website of DHR for more information: (stw.icmr.org.in) for more information.
