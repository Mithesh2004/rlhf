# Standard Treatment Workflow
CHEST TRAUMA
ICD-10-S29.9

INITIAL ASSESSMENT & MANAGEMENT
OF A TRAUMA PATIENT

### MECHANISM AND SCENARIO
*   Body acceleration and deceleration (Road traffic injury)
*   Body compression (Crush injuries fall from height)
*   Penetrating injuries (Missile injuries, stabs)

### PRESENTATION
*   Pain over the chest
*   Shortness of breath
*   Cyanosis
*   Swelling of chest wall
*   Facial/limb puffiness
*   Unconsciousness
*   Associated blood loss/pallor

### INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND PRIMARY SURVEY

Studies

Primary survey (ABCDEs) aims at recognition and management of immediate life-threatening injuries largely based on clinical examination.

#### ABCDE
*   Airway maintenance with cervical spine control
*   Breathing and ventilation
*   Circulation with haemorrhage control
*   Disability (brief neurological assessment)
*   Exposure/Environmental control: Prevent Hypothermia

#### OTHER VITALS
*   Blood pressure
*   All peripheral pulses
*   Altered/Muffled Heart Sounds

#### ALSO LOOK FOR
*   Neurological deficits
*   Tenderness over chest, first rib fracture
*   Subcutaneous emphysema

### ADJUNCT TO PRIMARY SURVEY
Obtain a portable AP chest x-ray to assess:
*   Intra-thoracic injuries
*   Endotracheal tube placement (if intubated)
*   Post chest tube insertion

### IMMEDIATE LIFE THREATENING CHEST INJURIES (LETHAL SIX)

### POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING CHEST INJURIES (HIDDEN SEVEN)

#### OESOPHAGEAL INJURY
*   DIAGNOSIS
    *   Diagnosed by food particles in ICD drainage or leak of dye in pleural cavity
*   MANAGEMENT
    *   Surgery

#### FLAIL CHEST
*   MANAGEMENT
    *   Pain control
    *   Oxygenation- Consider endotracheal intubation
    *   Chest tube insertion if associated with pneumothorax/hemothorax
    *   Consider transfer to closest appropriate facility

#### RUPTURED THORACIC AORTA
*   DIAGNOSIS
    *   Suspected on Chest x-ray
    *   Confirmation on CT angiography chest
*   MANAGEMENT
    *   Stenting/open surgery

#### CARDIAC CONTUSION
*   DIAGNOSIS
    *   By ECG, Echocardiograph and troponin levels
*   MANAGEMENT
    *   Give supportive treatment and consider transfer to closest appropriate facility

#### PULMONARY CONTUSION
*   CLINICAL FEATURES
    *   Dyspnoea, Tachypnoea, Tachycardia, Chest wall bruising, Flail Chest
*   DIAGNOSIS
    *   Diagnosed on Chest x-ray
*   MANAGEMENT
    *   Adequate analgesia
    *   Humidified oxygenation
    *   Consider endotracheal intubation
    *   Consider transfer to closest appropriate facility

#### SIMPLE PNEUMOTHORAX
*   TREATMENT
    *   Chest tube insertion (> 28Fr) in 4th/5th intercostal space just anterior to midaxillary line

#### RUPTURED DIAPHRAGM
*   Surgery

### ABBREVATION
*   ABG: Arterial Blood Gas
*   CT: Computed Tomography
*   CXR: Chest Radiography
*   DPL: Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage
*   ECG: Electrocardiogram
*   ICD: Intercostal Drainage Tube
*   FAST: Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma
*   MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging
*   NGT: Nasogastric Tube
