# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
IMAGE GUIDED MANAGEMENT OF VARICOSE VEINS
(CHRONIC VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY)
ICD-10-183.89

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

### SYMPTOMS
*   Heaviness/tiredness/aching of the legs
*   Itching in legs
*   Nocturnal cramps in calf
*   Swelling around ankle
*   Symptoms worsened after prolonged standing
*   Skin discoloration near the ankles
*   Abnormal dilated veins in leg
*   Bleeding from varicosities in leg
*   Non healing leg ulcer

### SIGNS (CEAP- CLASSIFICATION)
*   C1: Telangiectasias or reticular veins
*   C2: Varicose veins
*   C3: Edema
*   C4a: Pigmentation or eczema
*   C4b: Lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche
*   C5: Healed venous ulcer
*   C6: Active venous ulcer

### RED FLAGS
*   Bleeding from superficial veins
*   Venous ulcer
*   Recurrent history of superficial vein thrombophlebitis /Cellulitis

### CEAP- Classification C1
*   TELANGIECTASIAS
    *   Intradermal spider veins (web-like), <1mm
*   RETICULAR VEINS
    *   Subdermal reticular veins, <3mm
*   CEAP-CLASSIFICATION C2
    *   Great Saphenous vein with pronounced chronic venous insufficiency in medial ankle area
    *   Circumflex vein: Lateral branch of the greater saphenous vein
    *   Small saphenous vein varicosity

### CEAP-C3 CEAP-C4 CEAP-C6, C5= Healed ulcer

## INVESTIGATIONS

### ESSENTIAL
*   Imaging
    *   USG color doppler
*   Hematological
    *   CBC
    *   PT/INR
    *   APTT
    *   HBs Ag
    *   HIV
    *   KFT
    *   HCV

If there is proximal obstruction in common iliac vein, CTV or MRV is needed

### USG COLOR DOPPLER
*   Rule out **DVT**/Deep vein reflux
*   Doppler evaluation in standing
*   Define and grade reflux at **SFJ/SPJ**
*   Identify segmental intrinsic reflux in **GSV/SSV**
*   Locate incompetent/ pathological perforators
*   Diameter of **GSV**
*   Evaluate truncal and superficial vein varicosities and dilated tributaries

Incompetent **SFJ** - retrograde reflux venous flow lasting more than 0.5 sec
Abnormal **GSV** - ≥ 4 mm on standing
Incompetent perforator - ≥ 3.5 mm/reflux on release of distal compression

### Duration of Reflux

## MANAGEMENT

### MEDICAL/CONSERVATIVE
Mostly adjuvant to endovenous thermal ablation.
*   Life style modification
*   Graded compression stockings
*   Limb elevation, Limb massage, calf pumping exercise
*   Micronized purified flavonoid fraction (**MPFF**)
*   Wound care - Unna boots, hydrocolloid dressing, silver coated dressing

### IMAGE GUIDED THERAPY
*   Primary modality of treating varicose veins
*   Percutaneous endovenous Thermal Ablation Therapy: laser/RFA
*   Percutaneous endovenous Non-thermal Ablation Therapy: MOCA/Glue/ catheter guided sclerotherapy
*   Percutaneous ablation of Perforators - Laser/RFA
*   Percutaneous Guided Sclerotherapy.

### SURGICAL
*   Limited role
    *   Subfascial Endoscopic Perforator Surgery
    *   Phlebectomy

## VARICOSE VEINS: IR MANAGEMENT

*   Procedural details:
    *   Performed in IR suite
    *   Under conscious sedation or spinal anaesthesia or local anaesthesia
    *   Sterile precautions
    *   Percutaneous **GSV** access
    *   Perivenular anaesthesia
    *   Thermal ablation about 2 cm from **SFJ** unction
    *   Management of pathological perforator, **SSV**, accessory **GSV**, tributaries and superficial vein as and when required

## MANAGEMENT OF RED FLAG SIGN

*   Bleeding from superficial varicose veins:
    *   Leg elevation higher than the heart.
    *   Application of pressure over the bleeding site followed by a pressure dressing
    *   Referred to tertiary centre for endovenous ablation treatment

## RECOMMENDATION

*   For treatment of **GSV** reflux in patient with symptoms and sign of chronic venous disease endovenous thermal ablation technique is recommended in preference to surgery and foam sclerotherapy
*   For treatment of **SSV** reflux in patient with symptoms and sign of chronic venous disease endovenous thermal ablation technique should be considered. Access to **SSV** should be gained no lower than midcalf
*   Foam sclerotherapy should be considered as primary treatment in patient with recurrent varicose veins
*   When performing endovenous thermal ablation for saphenous reflux trunk, adding concomitant phlebectomy should be considered

## VENOUS ULCER

*   Wound care/Dressing
*   Compression Therapy
*   Leg elevation
*   Referred to tertiary centre for endovenous ablation treatment

## ALGORITHM: VARICOSE VEINS
