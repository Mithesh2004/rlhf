# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
CRITICAL HEART DISEASE IN THE NEWBORN
ICD-10-P09.5

## UNIVERSAL PULSE OXIMETRY SCREENING IS RECOMMENDED (REF 2)

### Measurement 1
Pulse oximetry on right arm and 1 foot around 24 hours of age (or earlier, if being discharged)

| Fail | Retest | Pass |
|---|---|---|
| Pulse oximetry of 89% or less in  either the right arm or foot  Action: Do not repeat pulse  oximetry screening, refer for  immediate assessment | a) Pulse oximetry of 90% to 94% in either  the right arm or foot or  b) A difference of 4% or more between  the right arm and foot  Action: Repeat pulse oximetry  measurements | Pulse oximetry of 95% or more in right arm and  foot and a difference of 3% or less between the 2  Action: Do not repeat pulse oximetry  screening, provide normal newborn care |

### Measurement 2
Pulse oximetry on right arm and 1 foot 1 hour after measurement 1

| Fail | Pass |
|---|---|
| a) Pulse oximetry of 94% or less in either the right arm or foot  or  b) A difference of 4% or more between the right arm and foot  Action: Do not repeat pulse oximetry screening, refer for  immediate assessment | Pulse oximetry of 95% or more in  right arm and foot and a difference  of 3% or less between the 2 Action: Do not repeat pulse  oximetry screening, provide  normal newborn care |

## Onset of cyanosis Possible CHD
| Onset of cyanosis | Possible CHD |
|---|---|
| 1st week (Day 1 to 7) | **dTGA** with intact ventricular septum **Hypoplastic left heart** or right heart **Tricuspid atresia/critical stenosis** of  **PV, MV, AV** **TOF** (severe) or **pulmonary atresia** **TAPVC** **Truncus arteriosus** **Ebstein’s anomaly** |
| 7 days to 1 month | **Hypoplastic left heart dextro-Transposition** of the **Great Arteries (dTGA)** **TOF Severe PS Truncus arteriosus** |
| Late onset cyanosis | **TOF Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) with VSD - PS, dTGA** with **VSD -PS, Tricuspid atresia** with **VSD -PS** |

## Hemodynamic approach to CHDs
*   **Duct dependent systemic circulation** (Critical AS, HLHS Severe Interrupted aortic arch)
    *   Hypotension/shock
    *   Ventricular dysfunction
    *   Arrhythmia with hemodynamic compromise

*   Decreased pulmonary blood flow (duct dependent pulmonary circulation): Pulmonary Atresia, Critical PS
    *   Severe desaturation
    *   TOF with severe PS
    *   Ebstein’s anomaly
*   Increased PBF & high PA pressure:
    *   Transposition

*   Pulmonary plethora: L -> R shunt
    *   With cyanosis/desaturation - **CCHD** with increased pulmonary blood flow (PBF)
    *   With severe desaturation and pulmonary venous hypertension: **Obstructed TAPVC**

## ASK/LOOK/FEEL CATEGORY INTERPRETATION

| ASK/LOOK/FEEL | CATEGORY | INTERPRETATION |
|---|---|---|
| Does the baby have decreased activity and feeds poorly? | Activity and feeding | Decreased activity is a common presentation of heart failure/shock in neonates |
| Is the baby cyanotic? Pulse Oximetry screen | Cyanosis/Desaturation | Look for bluish discolouration of fingers and tongue. If extremities are blue, to rule out  peripheral cyanosis- warm the baby and re check |
| Is there any evident respiratory distress or Tachypnoea? | Respiration | Chest indrawing/grunting/use of accessory muscles/RR more than 60 per minute |
| Does the baby have Inappropriate Tachycardia/Bradycardia | Heart Rate | Normal awake new born 100-180 normal sleeping new born 80-160 |
| Is the baby in shock? | Perfusion | Peripheries cold and clammy OR Cardiac  resynchronization therapy(CRT) > 3 seconds, core - peripheral temperature difference more than 2 degrees even after  warming/external temperature is controlled/  appropriate correction of ambient temperature  is done |
| Is the baby in heart failure? | Heart Failure | Look for Tachypnoea, Tachycardia, Tender Hepatomegaly |
| Is the baby sucking from the breast normally? | Feeding | Normal: sucking vigorously, no suck rest suck cycle, no breathlessness/ forehead sweating  while feeding, no prolonged feeding times |

## APPROACH TO SHOCK
*   Intravenous/Intraosseous access and fluid resuscitation 10 ml per kg of isotonic fluid, (max 40 ml per kg until perfusion improves or hepatomegaly develops).
*   Manage Hypothermia, Hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia
*   Appropriate antibiotic
*   Monitoring to assess response
*   Manage shock as per Neonatal shock guidelines

| Start PG E1  and refer if: | Septic shock likely if: |
|---|---|
|  • Identifiable that femoral pulses are distinctly feeble compared to upper  body  • Right arm - Any foot SpO2 difference  more than 3% | • Predisposing maternal and neonatal factors  • Core peripheral temperature difference > 3  • Sepsis Screen Positive |

*   Low threshold for Paediatric Cardiology Evaluation
*   Refractory Shock, Unlikely to be sepsis - Urgent referral to Pediatric Cardiologist

## APPROACH TO CYANOSIS
