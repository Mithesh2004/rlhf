    C --> D[Consider analgesics for short duration
    Acetaminophen/PCM and NSAIDs
    Short course muscle relaxants
    Use opioids (short duration) if not responding to above analgesics
    Immobilize neck in acute stage. Once pain subsides - start neck strengthening exercises and/or physical activity
    Recommend neck strengthening exercises and/or physical activity (when pain becomes bearable)
    Avoid lifting heavy weights
    Prescribe self-care strategies
    Alternating cold and heat therapy
    Continuation of Activities of Daily Living as tolerated
