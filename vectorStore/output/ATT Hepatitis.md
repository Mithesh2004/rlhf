# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**ANTITUBERCULAR THERAPY RELATED HEPATITIS**

PATIENT TO BE STARTED ON ATT

*   Risk factors for ATT Hepatitis
    *   History of underlying liver disease (**jaundice, ascites, Gl bleeding**)
    *   Physical findings suggestive of liver disease (**Splenomegaly, ascites, icterus, edema**)
    *   **Alcoholism**
    *   **Hypoalbuminemia** and **Malnutrition**
    *   Elevated aminotransferases at baseline
    *   **HIV**
    *   **IV drug abuse**
    *   Elderly age

Yes

Evaluate for underlying liver disease
**HBsAg, Anti-HCV, Ultrasound**

Chronic Liver
disease +

*   Intensive education & counselling
*   Modified ATT may be needed based on **Child Pugh Status**
*   **LFT monitoring**

Urgent ATT: life or organ
threatening

*   Sputum + Pulmonary TB
*   TB meningitis or CNS TB
*   Pericardial TB
*   Any form that is life threatening, eg., **Intestinal TB with intestinal obstruction**
*   **Ocular TB**
*   Joint or Spinal TB

No CLD or
Cirrhosis

*   Start ATT
*   Counsel about symptoms of ATT Hepatitis

No need for urgent
ATT

*   Sputum-ve Pulmonary TB
*   TB lymphadenitis
*   Tubercular pleural effusion
*   Tubercular ascites
*   Intestinal TB
*   Genitourinary TB
*   Bone TB

No

START ATT

Diagnosis of ATT hepatitis Clinical symptoms present (**abdominal pain, vomiting, unexplained fatigue, yellowing of sclera, altered sensorium**)
*   **AST/ALT** increased to 3 times of baseline/ULN
*   **Jaundice (Bilirubin 2 ULN)**

No clinical symptoms
*   **AST/ALT** increased to 5 times of baseline/ULN

Exclude viral hepatitis (**HBsAg, Anti-HCV, IgM- antiHAV, IgM-AntiHEV**), Get **PT/INR, Ultrasound** liver

Stop all hepatotoxic drugs

*   Need urgent ATT: Change to non-hepatotoxic drugs (**Fluroquinolones**, ethambutol & **aminoglycosides**)
*   No need for urgent ATT: repeat LFT after a week & reintroduce (see later)
*   Non-resolution of LFT abnormalities: exclude alternative causes of liver disease
*   Jaundice and coagulopathy/encephalopathy
*   Refer to higher center immediately

REINTRODUCTION OF ATT HЕРАТОХІC DRUGS

*   Reintroduce only if ALT and AST < 2 ULN & normal bilirubin
*   Start one drug at time: helps identify the culprit
*   Rifampicin may be introduced at **10 mg/kg** dose
*   After one week add **Isoniazid 5 mg/kg** if LFT normal
*   After one week add **pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg** if LFT is normal
*   If ATT hepatitis severe (**liver failure, coagulopathy or altered sensorium**): **Pyrazinamide** reintroduction may be avoided
*   Another approach could be low dose of one drug followed by full dose after three days
*   Duration of ATT: count only when full ATT is started

REINTRODUCTION OF ATT: IF AST AND ALT < 2 ULN

SEQUENTIAL

Initiate one at a time **Rifampicin 10 mg/kg**

1 week: repeat LFT

Initiate **Isoniazid 5 mg/kg**

1 week: repeat LFT

Initiate **Pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg**

CHILD PUGH (CTP) SCORE

| :---------- | :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- |
| **Bilirubin** | < 2 mg/dl             | 2-3 mg/dl             | >3 mg/dl             |
| **Albumin** | >3.5 gm/dl           | 2.8-3.5 gm/dl        | <2.8 gm/dl           |
| **INR**     | <1.7                 | 1.7-2.2              | >2.2                 |
| **Ascites** | Absent               | Slight               | Moderate             |
| **Encephalopathy** | Absent               | Grade 1-2            | Grade 3-4            |

HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY GRADE
Grade 0: normal consciousness, personality & neurological examination
Grade 1: restless, disturbances in sleep, irritability or agitated, tremors, handwriting affected
Grade 2: lethargy, disorientation to time, asterixis, ataxia
Grade 3: somnolent & stuporous, disoriented to place, hyperactive reflexes, rigidity
Grade 4: unrousable coma, decerebrate

INCREMENTAL

Initiate **Rifampicin 150 mg/day**
Gradually increase dose by day 4

Initiate **Isoniazid 100 mg/day** at day 8
Gradually increase dose by day 11

Initiate **Pyrazinamide 500 mg/day** on day 15
Gradually increase dose by day 18

ATT SELECTION FOR UNDERLYING LIVER DISEASE

| Child Status                 | Suggested ATT                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Child B Cirrhosis (Score 7-10) Advanced Liver Disease | One hepatotoxic drug regimen can be used: Two months of therapy with **INH (or) RIF** with **ETH** & **aminoglycoside**, followed by 10 months of therapy with **INH/RIF & ETH** |
| Child C Cirrhosis (Score 11-15) Very advanced liver disease | No hepatotoxic drug 18 to 24 months treatment using a combination of **ETH, FQL, cycloserine** & **aminoglycoside/ capreomycin**                           |
| In Acute hepatitis             | Avoid hepatotoxic drugs ATT with non-hepatotoxic drugs if urgent ATT required Wait till improvement in liver function if no urgent need of ATT                                    |
