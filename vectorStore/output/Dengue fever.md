# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of DENGUE FEVER
ICD-10-A90

## WHEN TO SUSPECT?
*   Fever and two of the following criteria -
    1.  Nausea
    2.  Vomiting
    3.  Rash
    4.  Myalgia
    5.  Headache
    6.  Retro orbital pain
    7.  Arthralgia
    8.  Hemorrhagic manifestations

## ASSESSMENT
*   Dengue without warning signs
*   Dengue with warning signs
*   Severe dengue

## TREATMENT OF PROBABLE DENGUE WITHOUT WARNING SIGNS
*   Symptomatic ambulatory treatment
*   Paracetamol for fever: avoid **NSAIDS**
*   Daily monitoring: clinical, PCV, platelets

## SEVERE DENGUE
*   Fluid accumulation with respiratory distress
*   Severe bleeding
*   Impaired consciousness

## REASONS FOR REFERRAL
*   Cold extremities, restlessness
*   Acute abdominal pain
*   Decreased urine output
*   Bleeding and hemoconcentration
*   Rising PCV & thrombocytopenia without clinical symptopms

## INVESTIGATIONS
### ESSENTIAL
*   Hb, TLC, DLC, Platelets, PCV
*   Positive tourniquet test
*   NS1 antigen (ELISA method)

### DESIRABLE
*   Chest X-ray
*   LFT, RFT, CPK, albumin
*   USG abdomen
*   Dengue IgM

### OPTIONAL
*   Echocardiography
*   PCR - dengue
*   CVP monitoring
*   USG guided measurement of collapsibility of IVC for monitoring hypovolemia

## SHOCK
Assess airway, breathing, circulation & start oxygen inhalation

### COMPENSATED SHOCK
(tachypnea, tachycardia, normotensive)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Ringer's Lactate/ NS 10 ml/kg/hr] --> B{Assess after every hour by checking HR, RR, BP, CVP and PCV}
    B -- No Improvement --> C[RL 10-15ml/kg/hr]
    B -- Improvement --> D[Further Improvement]
    C --> E{Assessment at second hour}
    E -- No Improvement --> F[RL 15ml/kg/hr]
    E -- Improvement --> G[RL 3-5ml/kg/hr]
    G --> H[Continue IV fluids till stable for 24 hours]
    F --> I{Assessment at third hour}
    I -- No Improvement --> J[Look for anemia, acidosis, myocardial dysfunction and treat accordingly]
    I -- Improvement --> K[RL 5-7ml/kg/1-2hr]
    K --> L[Once stable, observe for 24 hours, then discharge if the discharge criteria is fulfilled]
```

### HYPOTENSIVE SHOCK
(tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, peripheral pulses not palpable)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[20 ml/kg crystalloid or colloid in 15 minutes] --> B{Assessment of Shock (monitor HR, RR, BP, PCV and CVP)}
    B -- No Improvement --> C[Colloids 10-20ml/kg Blood Transfusion]
    B -- PCV Increased --> D[Colloids 10-20ml/kg Blood Transfusion]
    B -- PCV Decreased --> E[Assessment]
    E -- No Improvement --> F[Look for blood loss, acidosis cardiac dysfunction and treat accordingly]
    E -- Improvement --> G[Gradually decrease infusion rate 10ml/kg/hr 1-2 hr 7ml/kg for 2-3 hrs 5ml/kg for 2-4 hrs 3ml/kg for 2-4 hrs Stop at 48 hours]
```
In case of shock, start bolus and arrange for urgent referral with continuous monitoring by a health professional to facilities with a PICU.

## INDICATION FOR PLATELET TRANSFUSION & PACKED RED CELLS

### PACKED RED CELLS
*   Loss of blood (overt blood) 10% or more of total blood volume.
*   Refractory shock
*   Fluid overload

### PLATELETS
*   Prolonged shock
*   Prophylactic platelet transfusion (PLT <10.000/cumm)
*   Systemic massive bleeding

### FRESH FROZEN PLASMA/ CRYOPRECIPITATE
*   Coagulopathy with bleeding

## DISCHARGE CRITERIA (ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS MUST BE PRESENT)

### CLINICAL
*   No fever for 48 hours
*   Improvement in clinical status (check for general well-being, appetite, haemodynamic status, urine output, respiratory distress)

### LABORATORY
*   Increasing trend of platelet count
*   Stable haematocrit without intravenous fluids

KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES
