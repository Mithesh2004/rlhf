# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of **EPILEPSY**
ICD 10 - G40

| CLINICAL FEATURES |  |  |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Episodic, few secs-mins | Abnormal jerky movements | Loss of consciousness/ awareness | Blank staring | Episodes could be single with high risk of recurrence. Prolonged motor convulsion of > 5 mins with loss of consciousness - **STATUS EPILEPTICUS (SE)** - MEDICAL EMERGENCY |
| Sudden drops/falls, brief jerks | With or without urine/ stool incontinence, tongue bite, drooling | Bizzare activity out of context | Any other episode lasting for few mins (usually<5 mins) |  |

## PRIMARY HEALTH CENTRE (MEDICAL OFFICER)
*   Clinical diagnosis of epilepsy: detailed history from an eyewitness
*   Differentiate between provoked seizures and epilepsy (provoked due to fever, acute CNS insult, antibiotics, and metabolic causes)
*   Laboratory investigations: CBC, liver function tests, routine biochemistry, hemogram, lipd profile, vit D levels, TFT (whichever feasible)
*   Initiation of treatment:
    *   Treat the patient if patient has epilepsy (2 or more episodes of unprovoked seizures)
    *   Treat a single seizure if risk of recurrence is high as in patients with focal seizures, mentally retarded, neurological deficits having family history of seizures abnormal EEG, neuroimaging
*   Anti Epileptic Drug (AED broad spectrum, low dose, start low go slow, except status epilepticus)
*   Emergency medical care of status epilepticus
*   Treatment counselling: side effects/toxicities of drugs, red flags, importance of adherence, maintaining treatment diary
*   Advice on prevention of seizures: regular medication, sleep 7-8 hrs, avoid excess TV/mobile/photic stimulation, regular diet, lifestyle choices(avoid alcohol)
*   Evaluate any possibility of superimposed non-epileptic seizure
*   Training of MLP/ANM/ASHA on epilepsy
*   For excessive alcohol use, refer to ANM/MLP where psychosocial interventions are carried out for substance use disorders
*   Follow up visits for treatment monitoring & difficult patients under neurologist at STC centre
*   Basic management of co-morbidities (behaviour, cognition, reproductive health, bone health)
*   Alert to signs of abuse and neglect
*   Maintain upward referrals with paediatrician/physician at DH

## REASONS FOR REFERRAL
(centres with specialists like paediatrician, neurologist)

*   Redflag Signs
*   Progressive problems, rapid appearance of new symptoms
*   Recent injury
*   Symptoms appearing after alcohol binge
*   Status epilepticus after stabilization
*   Non response to adequate dose and duration of medication
*   Serious side effects
*   Neuroimaging

## DISTRICT HOSPITALS
*   Careful evaluation of all referral patients, provide specialized management for patients and refer back to PHC for follow up of management
*   Maintain communication, ongoing clinical support and supervision of MOs at PHC
*   Laboratory investigation CBC, liver function tests, antiepileptic drug levels, routine biochemistry, hemogram, lipid profile, vit D levels, TFT, CT brain (when necesary)
*   Monitor side effects of AED
*   Clinical Psychologist: counselling health services for persons with epilepsy or upon referral from PHC/UPHC

## RED FLAG SIGNS
*   Fever
*   Headache
*   Vomiting
*   Altered Sensorium
*   Severe Giddiness
*   Loss of function of body
