# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## APPROACH TO HYPONATREMIA
ICD-10-E87.1

Assessment of Volume status

### Hypovolemia
*   Total body water↓
*   Total body sodium↓↓↓↓

### Euvolemia (No edema)
*   Total body water↑
*   Total body sodium →

### Hypervolemia
*   Total body water ↑↑
*   Total body sodium↑

### UNa>20
### UNa <20
### UNa>20
### UNa <20

### Renal Losses
*   Diuretic excess
*   Mineralocorticoid
    deficiency
*   Salt losing deficiency
*   Bicarbonaturia with renal
    tubal acidosis and
    metabolic alkalosis
*   Ketonuria
*   Osmotic diuresis
*   Cerebral salt wasting
    syndrome

### Extrarenal Losses
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Third spacing of
    fluids
*   Burns
*   Pancreatitis
*   Trauma

### - Glucocorticoid
    deficiency
*   Hypothyroidism
*   Stress
*   Drugs
*   SIADH

### Renal failure

### Nephrotic syndrome
### Cirrhosis
### Cardiac failure

TREATMENT

Intravenous hydration with isotonic normal saline in
hypovolemic hyponatremia
Treatment of underlying disease in hypervolemic
hyponatremia

Is Hyponatremia severe? (<125 mmol/L)

#### Yes
#### No

Vomiting, seizures, obtundation, coma,
respiratory distress, unstable gait/ falls
Significant sequelae unlikely

##### Yes
##### No

Likely Chronic
Headache, irritability, difficulty in
concentration, altered mood,
depression

Severe hyponatremia
treatment Acute < 48 hours
Emergency correction with
hypertonic 3% saline 1-2 ml/kg/hr
until safe Na target to a total
4-6m/M, this modest increase is
sufficient to alleviate severe
symptoms. After that corrective
guidelines chronic hyponatremia
are appropriate

Chronic/Unknown ( > 48 hours)
Correction with 3% saline@
0.5-1ml/kg/hour till resolution of
symptoms or until safe Na target
Correction* not > 8-10 mM within first
24 hours
Oral Tolvaptan 15 mg on day one and
then 30-60 mg per day if serum Na
remains below 135 or rise is less than 5
mmol per 24 hours. 6 -8 hourly
monitoring of serum Na to be done

Urgent intervention unnecessary
Assess ECF volume and restrict fluid
intake to 500-1000 ml/ 24 hour

Assess ECF Volume status

Na deficit = .6x body weight (target Plasma Na-starting Na concentration)
1 litre of 3% hypertonic saline=513mM Na (1ml/kg/hr increases serum Na by 1mM/hr)
1 litre of isotonic saline= 154 mM Na
*Rapid correction of sodium is not
advisable as it may lead to central
pontine myelinosis

ABBREVIATIONS

ECF: Extracellular fluid
Na: Sodium
SIADH: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion
Una: Urinary sodium

KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES

This STW has been prepared by national experts of India with feasibility considerations for various levels of healthcare system in the country. These broad guidelines are advisory, and
are based on expert opinions and available scientific evidence. There may be variations in the management of an individual patient based on his/her specific condition, as decided by
the treating physician. There will be no indemnity for direct or indirect consequences. Kindly visit the website of DHR for more information: (stw.icmr.org.in) for more information.
