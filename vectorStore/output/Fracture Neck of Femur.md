# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
FRACTURE NECK OF FEMUR
ICD-10-S72.0

## FEMORAL NECK FRACTURES
*   Femoral neck fractures
    are intracapsular
    fractures

## RISK FACTORS
*   **Osteoporosis**
*   Advancing age
*   Increased number of
    comorbidities
*   Increased dependency
    with Activities of Daily
    Living (**ADL**)

## FIRST AID
*   Pain relief
*   Immobilisation of (Splintage including
    hip, knee & ankle to minimize movements
    at fracture site during transport)

## SYMPTOMS
*   Severe pain in the hip after fall/
    Road Traffic Accident (**RTA**)
*   Limb in a deformed position
    (usually external rotation) and
    shortening
*   Unable to move and stand on
    the injured limb
*   Bruising and swelling around
    the hip

## SIGNS
*   Limb is short and
    externally rotated
*   Patient unable to
    stand or do active
    straight leg raising
*   Marked tenderness
    at hip joint

## RADIOGRAPHS
*   X ray Pelvis with bilateral hips- **AP**
*   Involved hip with thigh - **AP** (with hips
    in internal rotation to see the entire
    neck properly) and lateral view

## GARDEN CLASSIFICATION
*   Type I: Incomplete fracture/Valgus
    impacted
*   Type II: Complete fracture without
    displacement of the fracture
    fragments
*   Type III: Complete fracture with
    partial displacement of the fracture
    fragments
*   Type IV: Fracture is complete with
    total displacement of the fracture
    fragments

## MANAGEMENT
### VALGUS/UNDISPLACED
(TYPE I & TYPE II)
*   In situ internal fixation at the
    earliest possible
*   Three 6.5 cancellous screws
    (Threads crossing fracture site)
    should be placed in inverted
    triangle or triangular configuration

### DISPLACED (TYPE III & TYPE IV)
UPTO AGE 60 YEARS
*   Closed reduction in anatomical
    position
*   If closed reduction is not possible
    then open reduction should be
    done
*   Fracture fixation is performed by
    either multiple screw fixation or by
    Dynamic Hip Screw (**DHS**) with
    de-rotation screw

### DHS WITH DE-ROTATION SCREW
Cervicotrochanteric basal neck
femur
Pauwel's type III fracture

### MORE THAN 60 YEARS
*   Displaced femoral neck fractures
    require arthroplasty
    *   Unipolar (Austin Moore
        prosthesis)
    *   Modular bipolar prosthesis
    *   Total Hip Replacement (**THR**)

### INDICATIONS OF THR
*   Intracapsular fracture associated
    with marked arthritis of the hip
*   Pathological fractures in patients
    more than 60 years

## ABBREVIATIONS
**ADL**: Activities of Daily Living
**AP**: Antero-posterior
**DHS**: Dynamic Hip Screw
