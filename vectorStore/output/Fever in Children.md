# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of FEVER IN CHILDREN
ICD-10-R50

FEVER IS Core (rectal) temperature ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) or axillary temperature > 37.5°C (100.4°F).

## What to Ask?
*   Fever duration
*   Localizing symptoms of: RTI, UTI, GI tract infection, CNS infection
*   Rash, joint symptoms, skin/soft tissue swelling or redness
*   Vaccination within 24 hours, drug/toxin exposure
*   Family/neighbourhood history of similar illness

## Examination
*   Vital signs: Temp, HR, RR, BP, CFT
*   Appearance: Sick, toxic, lethargic, irritable, inconsolable, dehydrated

### General Examination
*   Ear, nose, throat
*   Rash (petechiae, macules, papules, vesicles, nodules, polymorphic)
*   Lymphadenopathy
*   Skin (pustules, pyoderma, impetigo, cellulitis)
*   Joints
*   Genitalia (for erythema, tenderness, edema)
*   Bones

### Systemic Examination
*   Chest auscultation, abdominal palpation, CNS, CVS

## Clues to a Specific Diagnosis
*   **Fever + respiratory symptoms:**
    *   Cough, runny nose: URTI
    *   Membrane over tonsils/pharynx: Diphtheria
    *   Paroxysmal cough: Pertussis like illness
    *   Barking cough: Laryngotracheobronchitis/ croup
*   **Fever + rash**
    *   Red maculopapular rash: Measles, Rubella, Dengue.
    *   Fine generalized maculopapular rash with systemic dysfunction/shock: Meningococcemia.
    *   Itchy erythematous macules evolving to clear vesicles: Varicella
*   **Fever + other symptoms:**
    *   Parotid gland swelling: Mumps
    *   Arthritis: Consider Chikungunya, acute rheumatic fever, JIA
    *   Strawberry red tongue, skin peeling, lymphadenopathy, conjunctival injection: Kawasaki disease

## Investigation of the Febrile Child
(Consider if one or more of the following are warranted. Perform investigations only where result impacts management)

### <7 Days Fever Alone
*   **ESSENTIAL:**
    *   If fever <72 hours and child not looking sick: No investigations
    *   If fever >72 hours, consider: TLC, DLC, P.S for leukocyte morphology, malarial parasite & platelet count
*   **DESIRABLE:** Rapid antigen test for malaria, NS1 antigen and dengue IgM antibody, blood culture
*   **OPTIONAL:** C reactive protein, procalcitonin

### <7 Days and Localizing Symptoms Present
*   **ESSENTIAL:** As given in the first box
*   **DESIRABLE:** As given in the first box + consider: (Clean-catch) urine microscopy & culture, chest Xray, CSF analysis
*   **OPTIONAL:** As given in the first box + consider: ultrasonography, throat/ pharyngeal swab, pus aspiration.

### <7 Days and Non Specific Symptoms
*   **ESSENTIAL:** As given before
*   **DESIRABLE:** As given before. Additionally consider: serology for specific viral infection, rapid antigen test for malaria, NS1 antigen and dengue IgM antibody, blood culture, serology for scrub typhus
*   **OPTIONAL:** As given before

### >7 Days and Fever Alone or Without Localizing Symptoms
*   **ESSENTIAL:** All mentioned in Essential & Desirable list in the prior boxes. Additionally consider Widal test.
*   **DESIRABLE:** Consider Mantoux test, ultrasonography
*   **OPTIONAL:** As given before. Additionally consider: Ultrasonography of abdomen, chest, pericardium, joint(s), abscess, lymph node clusters, parotid gland etc, for microscopy, Xpert MTB RIF assay, Mycobacterial culture. Consider: bone marrow, ANA-profile, HIV serology, echocardiography, CT PET scan.

### >7 Days and Localizing Symptoms Present
*   **ESSENTIAL:** All investigations mentioned in the prior boxes
*   **DESIRABLE:**All investigations mentioned in the prior boxes. Additionally consider: serology for Brucella, CMV, Herpes, Japanese encephalitis. CT scan in deep seated abscess or lung abscess, Bone marrow examination, ANA profile, HIV serology, PET scan.
*   **OPTIONAL:** All investigations mentioned in the prior boxes

    B --> C(STEP 3: CONSIDER REFERRAL TO TERTIARY CARE CENTRE);
    C --> D(STEP 4: EMPIRIC MANAGEMENT);
    D --> E(STEP 5: CONSIDER DISCHARGE WHEN);
```

### STEP 1
*   **INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND STABILIZATION**
    *   Manage urgent issues
    *   Decrease body temperature with Paracetamol (15mg/kg by any route) and/or hydrotherapy.
    *   Manage any life-threatening issue.
    *   Consider first dose antibiotic in suspected meningitis, severe pneumonia, or severe malnutrition.
    *   Consider anti-malarial in suspected malaria

### STEP 2
*   **CONSIDER HOSPITALIZATION FOR OBSERVATION/ MANAGEMENT IN**
    *   All neonates
    *   Young infants with toxic appearance.
    *   Severe malnutrition, toxic appearance, inability to feed, lethargy, irritability, dehydration, etc.
    *   >14 days illness without diagnosis.
    *   Any reason deemed by the treating physician.

### STEP 3
*   **CONSIDER REFERRAL TO TERTIARY CARE CENTRE**
    *   (after appropriate stabilization and/or initial management):
        *   Need for intensive care
        *   Complex multi-system disease.
        *   Confirmed complications of the primary illness

### STEP 4
*   **EMPIRIC MANAGEMENT**
    *   Consider based on likely diagnosis, sickness status, and availability of investigation facilities.
    *   Empiric treatment should be tailored based on subsequently available investigation reports & local antimicrobial sensitivity.
    *   Anti tuberculosis treatment (ATT) should not be started on empiric basis except in suspected TBM

### STEP 5
*   **CONSIDER DISCHARGE WHEN**
    *   Afebrile > 48 hours or fever is showing defervescence
    *   Feeding well
    *   Presenting symptoms (in addition to fever) resolved/resolving
    *   Physician is satisfied that further care can be continued on ambulatory basis
    *   Duration of i.v antibiotic therapy is completed
