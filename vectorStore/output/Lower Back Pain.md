LOWER BACK PAIN
ICD-10-M54.2

## HISTORY
*   Lower back pain-acute or chronic
*   Severity of pain
*   Site and onset of pain
*   Radiation of pain
*   Associated features such as fever, trauma, weight lifting, associated tingling or numbness
*   History related to **Pelvic Inflammatory disease (PID)**- if positive-refer to Gynecologist
*   Anticonvulsants and steroids intake

## RED FLAG SIGNS
*   Features of **Cauda Equina Syndrome** including sudden onset of loss of bladder/bowel control, **saddle anesthesia** and weakness of lower limbs
*   Severe worsening pain, especially at night or when lying down
*   Significant history of trauma
*   Weight loss, history of cancer, fever
*   Use of prolonged steroids or intravenous drugs
*   First episode of severe pain in patient over 50 years of age

## Conduct a full assessment including
*   History taking
*   Physical and neurological examination
*   Evaluation of red flags
*   Psychosocial risk factors

    A[Conduct a full assessment] --> B{Red Flag Signs};
    B -- Yes --> C[Consider referral to higher center for evaluation];
    B -- No --> D{Acute and Sub acute-duration less than 12 weeks};
    D --> E[Consider analgesics for short duration
    Acetaminophen
    NSAIDS
    Short course muscle relaxants
    Use opioids (short duration) if not
    responding to above analgesics
    Recommend back strengthening exercises and/
    or physical activity (when pain becomes
    bearable), avoid heavy weight lifting activities
    Prescribe self-care strategies
    Alternating cold and heat therapy
    Continuation of Activities of Daily Living as
    tolerated
    Encourage early return to work
    Educate patient that low back pain usually
    resolves with time
    Re-assess at 2-6 weeks (including Red Flags) if
    patient is not returning to normal function or
    symptoms are worsening
    Consider lab test and imaging*]
    D --> F{Chronic-duration greater than 12 weeks};
    F --> G[Consider lab test and imaging (X-rays)
    Prescribe back strengthening exercises or therapeutic
    exercise
    Analgesic options
    Acetaminophen
    NSAIDS
    Short term muscle relaxant for flare-ups
    Pain not responding to above
    Opioids for short term in severe pain
    Low dose antidepressants for short duration
    Other modalities
    Physiotherapy
    TENS as adjunct to active therapy etc
    If pain still does not subside then consider Referral
    Modalities at Referral centre
    Multidisciplinary chronic pain program/clinic
    Epidural steroids (for short-term relief of radicular pain)
    Surgery in carefully selected patients after expert opinion
    and based on indications]
```

## Consider lab test and imaging*
*   Consider Referral
    *   Physical therapist
    *   Orthopeadic surgeon (for unresolving radicular symptoms)
    *   Multidisciplinary pain program (if not returning to work)

*Based on provisional diagnosis - Lab and imaging Test*

*   Lab tests
    *   Hemogram with ESR and CRP
*   Imaging
    *   X rays LS Spine- Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral
    *   MRI LS spine
    *   DEXA Scan- suspected osteoporosis

## ABBREVIATIONS
*   CRP: C-reactive Protein
*   DEXA: Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry
*   LS: Lumbo-Sacral
*   ESR: Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate
*   MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging
*   NSAIDs: Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs
*   PID: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
*   TENS: Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation
