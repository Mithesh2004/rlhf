# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
NEONATAL SEIZURES
ICD-10-P90

## NEONATES AT RISK FOR SEIZURES
*   Birth asphyxia
*   Sepsis
*   Meningitis
*   Preterm
*   Small for gestational age
*   Metabolic or electrolyte abnormalities
*   Major bleeding

## IDENTIFICATION OF SEIZURES

### Motor manifestations
*   Rhythmic jerks of limb(s) or facial part(s)
*   Tonic contraction of limb(s)
*   Stereotypical movements of limbs, face, eyes
    *   Limbs: Pedalling, rowing, swimming, cycling, stepping
    *   Oral: Pouting of lips, mouthing, repeated sucking
    *   Eyes: Vacant stare, transient eye deviation, nystagmoid movements, repeated blinking

### Behavioural manifestations
*   Sudden change in consciousness or cry characteristic

### Autonomic manifestations
*   Fluctuations in heart rate, sudden change in BP, sudden appearance of unexplained apneic episodes

## HISTORY
*   Antenatal: First trimester viral illness, PIH, diabetes, PROM/ chorioamnionitis, STDS, drugs or substance abuse, decreased fetal movements
*   Intrapartum: Fetal distress, difficult delivery, cord complications, mode of delivery, instrumentation
*   Postnatal: Resuscitation, other organ system involvement, feeding history
*   Seizure details: onset, duration, description (review videos)
*   Family: Consanguinity, early neonatal deaths, mental retardation, epilepsy

## EXAMINATION
*   Vital signs: Temp, BP, HR, RR, CFT, SpO2
*   General: pallor, icterus, rash, skin lesions
*   Head to toe: Head circumference, bulging fontanelle, needle marks on scalp, dysmorphism, malformations, petechie, ecchymoses
*   Systemic exam: Level of alertness, cranial nerve and motor exam, examination of all systems
*   Fundus examination

## INVESTIGATIONS
*   In all neonates: Blood glucose, Serum electrolytes, hemogram, ionized calcium, blood urea/creatinine, liver function tests, blood gas analysis, cranial ultrasound
*   Specific circumstances
    *   Suspected sepsis: cerebrospinal fluid examination
    *   Suspected TORCH infections: paired mother and baby serology (for toxoplasma, CMV, rubella), body fluids for PCR (urine for CMV), CSF for toxoplasma, CMV, herpes
    *   Suspected intracranial bleed: Ultrasound or CT or MRI head, Platelet count and Coagulogram
    *   Electroencephalography

## ACUTE MANAGEMENT OF SEIZURES

graph TD
    A[Neonate with seizure] --> B{Ensure TABC, IV access. Check blood glucose by Glucometer};
    B -- BG < 45 mg/dL Yes --> C[10% dextrose 2 mL/kg bolus, followed by infusion @ 6 mg/kg/min];
    B -- BG < 45 mg/dL No --> D{If available, measure ionized Calcium (iCa). If iCa <1.0 mmol/L and seizures persist, repeat Calcium dose};
    C --> E[Follow STW on Neonatal Hypoglycemia];
    D --> F[2 mL/kg 10% calcium gluconate IV, diluted 1:1 with D5, D10 or DW over 10 min under cardiac monitoring];
    F --> G[Seizures persist];
    G --> H[Inj. Phenobarbitone 20 mg/kg IV over 15 mins. If seizures persist after 15 min. consider another bolus of 10mg/kg phenobarbitone over 10 min. Assess seizure control after 15 min];
    H --> I[Seizures persist];
    I --> J[Phenytoin or Fosphenytoin 20 mg/kg PE: infuse over 20 min under cardiac monitoring. Assess seizure control after 30 min];
    J --> K[Seizures persist];
    K --> L[Give Lorazepam 0.05 mg/kg IV over 2-5 mins. Can repeat dose once if seizures persist];
    L --> M[Seizures persist];
    M --> N[Consider referral. Follow STW on Neonatal Transport];
```

*   Goal of the treatment is the total or near total elimination of seizures. However, with higher doses and addition of more anti-epileptic drugs, the neonate requires intensive respiratory and cardiac monitoring. If recurrent seizures, isolated twitches may be just monitored
*   Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV bolus, followed by continuous infusion (1µg/kg/min) increasing by 0.5 to 1 µg/kg/min every 2 min until a favorable response or max. 18 µg/kg/min
*   Levetiracetam 40 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 40-60 mg/kg/day IV or oral in 2-3 divided doses

## DURATION OF ANTICONVULSANTS
*   Maintenance therapy is not needed in case of a single brief seizure that needs only one loading dose of phenobarbitone
*   If more than one loading dose OR more than one drug is needed to control seizures - start the maintenance dose 24 h after the loading dose of the respective drugs. Prefer oral route if no contraindication
*   After a seizure-free period of 72 h, stop all other anticonvulsants one by one, except phenobarbitone
*   After one week or at discharge (whichever is earlier), stop phenobarbitone if neurological examination and EEG are normal. If the neurological examination or EEG is abnormal (electrical seizure activity or a burst-suppression background): discharge on maintenance therapy
*   Review at monthly intervals and taper anticonvulsants if neurological examination and EEG become normal
*   If anticonvulsants are required beyond 3 months, consult a neurologist and switch to other drugs

NEONATES WITH SEIZURES REQUIRE LONG TERM NEURODEVELOPMENTAL FOLLOW-UP AND HEARING ASSESSMENT

This STW has been prepared by national experts of India with feasibility considerations for various levels of healthcare system in the country. These broad guidelines are advisory, and are based on expert opinions and available scientific evidence. There may be variations in the management of an individual patient based on his/her specific condition, as decided by the treating physician.
