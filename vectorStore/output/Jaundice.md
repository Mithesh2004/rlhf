# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## JAUNDICE
ICD-10-R17

### SIGNS & SYMPTOMS
*   Viral prodrome
*   Loss of appetite/ nausea/ vomiting
*   High coloured urine
*   Pain abdomen
*   Fever
*   Itching, clay coloured stools

### ESSENTIAL TESTS
**SERUM BILIRUBIN > 1.5 mg/DL**
*   Anorexia/ nausea/ vomiting
*   Viral Prodrome
*   LFT/SGOT/SGPT ↑↑
*   SAP↑
*   USG: NO BILIARY DILATATION
*   PARENCHYMAL LIVER DISEASE (HEPATITIS)
*   Pain
*   Pruritus
*   Clay coloured stool
*   ↑LFT/SGOT/SGPT ↑↑
*   SAP ↑↑
*   USG: BILIARY DILATATION
*   BILIARY OBSTRUCTION

### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: COMMON CAUSES
*   **JAUNDICE (ISOLATED RAISED BILIRUBIN)**
    *   Hemolytic anaemia
    *   Congenital hyperbilirubinemia
*   **OBSTRUCTIVE JAUNDICE**
    *   Benign:
        *   Common bile duct stone
        *   Biliary stricture
    *   Malignant:
        *   Carcinoma gall bladder
        *   Carcinoma pancreas
        *   Peri-ampullary carcinoma
        *   Cholangiocarcinoma
*   **PARENCHYMAL LIVER DISEASE**
    *   Viral hepatitis
    *   Alcoholic hepatitis
    *   Drug induced hepatitis (eg: ATT)
    *   Autoimmune hepatitis
*   **SYSTEMIC INFECTIONS (USUALLY WITH FEVER)**
    *   Complicated malaria
    *   Enteric fever
    *   Dengue fever
    *   Scrub typhus
    *   Leptospirosis

### SUPPORTIVE LAB EVIDENCE
*   Isolated rise in bilirubin (indirect bilirubin > direct bilirubin)
*   Normal values of SGOT, SGPT, SAP, GGT
*   Normal ultrasonography of liver & biliary system
*   Significantly elevated SAP (>4-5 X Upper limit of normal)
*   Normal/ mildly elevated SGOT & SGPT
*   Imageing show biliary obstruction
*   Elevated SGOT & SGPT (usually >5 x Upper limit of normal; < 500 in alcoholic hepatitis)
*   Viral markers/history of alcohol/hepatotoxic drugs
*   In appropriate clinical setting:
    *   Peripheral smear for malarial parasite or blood culture or widal test/ appropriate serology

### MANAGEMENT
*   **Hemolytic disease:**
    *   Start tablet Folic acid 5 mg once a day and refer to a hematologist
*   **Congenital hyperbilirubinemia:**
    *   Reassurance & refer to higher center for confirmation
    *   Normal diet
*   Start IV antibiotics if patient has fever and/or elevated TLC for suspected cholangitis
*   Start IV fluids if patient dehydrated
*   Refer to higher centre with facility for CT for CT scan/MRCP for further work up
*   Rx: ERCP/PTBD/Surgery
*   Normal diet
*   Maintain hydration
*   Symptomatic Rx eg. antiemetics
*   Normal diet
*   Treat specific infectious illness
*   Thiamine for alcoholic hepatitis
*   AVOID ALCOHOL AND ALL NON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
*   Treat specific systemic infection
*   Normal diet

### REFERRAL TRIGGERS
*   INR >1.5 or rising INR- may be an early indicator of liver failure
*   Altered sensorium
*   Bleeding
*   Recurrent vomiting with dehydration
*   Hypotension (systolic BP <90 mmHg)

### ABBREVIATIONS
*   ATT: Anti tubercular drugs
*   Bilirubin: Direct=conjugated, indirect=unconjugated
*   ERCP: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
*   LFT: Liver function test
*   GGT: gamma-glutamyl transferase
*   MRCP: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
*   PTBD: Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
*   SAP: Serum Alkaline Phosphatase
*   SGOT: Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase
*   SGPT: Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase
*   TLC: Total Leucocyte Count
