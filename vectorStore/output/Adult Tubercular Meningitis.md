# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of **ADULT TUBERCULAR MENINGITIS**
ICD-10-17.0

## SUSPECT TBM WITH FOLLOWING CLINICAL FEATURES
*   Fever (Duration of 5 days or more#+)
*   Headache & Vomiting
*   Altered sensorium
*   Cranial nerve palsy
*   Hemiparesis/any limb weakness
*   Seizures
*   Neck pain and stiffness

## ALWAYS ENQUIRE FOR ASSOCIATED FEATURES
*   Constitutional symptoms
*   Active TB elsewhere
*   Past history of TB & ATT
*   Contact with TB patient
*   HIV seropositivity
*   Low socio-economic status
*   High endemic area

#This is to increase sensitivity for diagnosis of TBM. The duration could be variable from days to weeks to months.
+Clinical judgement & evaluation of other conditions is also required as fever can be associated with headache in other medical conditions. Delaying work up for meningitis is not recommended.

## IF TBM SUSPECTED
Refer to a centre where facility of evaluation (at least Lumbar puncture & CT scan) is available.

## EVALUATION AT CENTRE OF CARE

### CLINICAL HISTORY & EXAMINATION
*   Symptoms type & duration, onset & progression
*   Headache, altered sensorium, focal deficits
*   Neck rigidity, Kernig's sign
*   Cranial nerve palsy
*   Fundus examination - papilledema

### LABORATORY EVALUATION
*   CBC, ESR, CRP
*   LFT, RFT, Electrolytes
*   Blood sugar, HIV
*   Chest X Ray- PA view
*   USG whole abdomen
*   Mantoux (optional)

### IMAGING
*   NCCT/CECT head- Preferred as initial investigation
*   MRI brain (and spine if indicated) in selective cases

### CSF
*   Mandatory- Should be sent for essential analysis (Box 1)
*   Prudent to perform CT head prior to CSF in presence of papilledema &/or focal deficits

### COMMON NEUROIMAGING FINDINGS IN TBM
Basal exudates and Hydrocephalus Tuberculomas Infarction Arachnoiditis Pott's spine

### CSF EVALUATION*

|  | 01 ESSENTIAL | 02 DESIRABLE | 03 OPTIONAL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | *   Cell count & type
*   Protein
*   Sugar (& Correspon-ding blood sugar)
*   NAAT
*   Grams stain
*   Bacterial culture
*   AFB stain
*   AFB culture/sensitivity
*   India Ink**
*   Cryptococcal antigen** | *   Fungal smear & culture
*   Cytopathology# | *   Wet mount
*   VDRL
*   Toxoplasma PCR+
*   Viral PCR |

If some tests are not available at site, store sample in sterile container, keep in refrigerator & transport in icebox to other facility

'CSF samples should be sent to the lab as soon as possible for examination of cells, protein, sugar and cytology.
"Cryptococcal meningitis should be excluded wherever possible as it is a close differential diagnosis of TBM.
"In ideal settings, it may be prudent to exclude a diagnosis of carcinomatous meningitis.
Especially in patients with HIV.

### CSF FINDINGS IN TBM AND OTHER MENINGITIS

| MENINGITIS TYPE | CELL COUNT | PREDOMINANT CELL TYPE | PROTEIN | SUGAR | SPECIFIC TESTS FOR CONFIRMATION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tubercular | Usually <500 | Lymphocytic Neutrophilic in some acute cases | High | Low | AFB smear & culture NAAT*Φ |
| Pyogenic | In thousands | Neutrophilic | Moderately High | Very low | Gram stain, culture |
| Fungal | Variable | Lymphocytic | High | Low | India Ink, Fungal Culture, Cryptococcal antigen |
| Viral | 50-500 | Lymphocytic | Normal to marginally high | Normal | PCR for specific virus |

A negative NAAT result does not rule out TBM. The decision to give ATT should be based on clinical features and CSF profile.
NAAT: Xpert/TrueNat

## MANAGEMENT

### ANTI-TUBERCULAR TREATMENT
*   Intensive Phase: 2 months of RHZE or RHZS
*   Continuation phase: 3 drugs: RHZ# for at least 10 months

### STEROIDS
*   Preferably Dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg/day intravenously in 3-4 divided doses during hospital stay
*   If not feasible, give oral Dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg/day in divided doses or oral Prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day in single morning dose
*   Discharge on oral steroids on tapering doses for a total duration of 8-12 weeks
\*treatment duration may be increased in some cases as per the clinician decision
#This is as per strong recommendations of concerned specialty experts in view of high toxicity of Ethambutol on TBM. These recommendations have been sent to NTEP

### FOLLOW UP
*   Regular follow up is essential every month for at least first 3 months & can be increased thereafter till treatment is stopped
*   Monitor liver function tests & any other features of drug toxicity
*   Observe for clinical improvement or any deterioration
*   Closely observe for development of any complications

### SUSPECT COMMON COMPLICATIONS
*   Hydrocephalus and raised ICP: Worsening of headache with vomitings and/or altered sensorium
*   Optico-chiasmatic arachnoiditis: Complaints of vision loss in one or both eyes with or without headache
*   Myelitis and or arachnoiditis: Development of paraparesis or quadriparesis with/without sensory disturbances, bladder involvement
*   Epidural abscess/Pott's spine: Complaints of back pain and/or weakness in one/ both lower limbs/bladder/ bowel disturbances
*   Tuberculoma: Seizures, new onset focal focal deficits, worsening headache
*   Seizures: Consider tuberculoma/electrolyte or metabolic imbalance/cerebral infarction
*   Cerebral infarction and stroke: Sudden onset weakness of one half of body, new onset confusion, altered mental status, seizures
*   Hyponatremia, SIADH: Persistent or worsening mental status
