## WHEN TO SUSPECT ?
9

### SYMPTOMS
*   Rapid irregular heart beat with or without
*   General fatigue or weakness or exhaustion
*   Dizziness, near syncope or syncope
*   Shortness of breath
*   Chest pain
*   More marked on exertion

### SIGNS
*   Irregularly irregular pulse
*   Variable heart sound

### LOOK FOR RISK FACTORS
*   Prior valvular heart disease or CHF or MI
*   Prior TIA or stroke or embolic episode
*   Hypertension, DM, COPD,CKD, Obesity

### LOOK FOR PRECIPITATING FACTORS:
*   Post (cardiac) surgery
*   Alcoholism or binge drinking
*   Myo-pericarditis or ACS
*   Pneumonitis or pulmonary embolism
*   Sepsis, hyperthyroidism

### MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES:
*   Categorize AF
*   Look for immediate intervention indicators
*   Assess stroke risk & need for anti-coagulation
*   Assess bleeding risk
*   Need for rate control
*   Consideration for rhythm control

### CATEGORIZE AF
*   Paroxysmal AF: Episodes of AF for less than 7 days
*   Persistent AF: AF lasing from 7 days to 1 year
*   Long standing perssistent AF: AF lasting for > 1 year
*   Permanent AF: AF with heart rate control as only option

### LOOK FOR IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION INDICATORS:
*   Systolic BP 90 mmHg, HR > 150 or <50/min
*   Ongoing Angina
*   CHF or TIA or stroke
*   Major bleed on OAC (define)

## STROKE RISK SCORE
CHA2DS2-VASc

|  | SCORE |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Congestive heart failure/LV dysfunction | 1 |
| Hypertension | 1 |
| Aged > 75 years | 2 |
| Diabetes mellitus | 1 |
| Stroke/TIA/ΤΕ | 2 |
| Vascular disease [prior MI, PAD or aortic plaque] | 1 |
| Age (e.g. >65) | 1 |
| Sex category [i.e. female gender] | 1 |
| Maximum Score | 9 |

## BLEEDING RISK SCORE
HAS-BLED

|  | SCORE |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Hypertension i.e. uncontrolled BP | 1 |
| Abnormal renal/ liver function | 1 or 2 |
| Stroke | 1 |
| Bleeding tendency or predisposition | 1 |
| Labile INR | 1 |
| Age (e.g. >65)Aged 65-74 years | 1 |
| Drugs (e.g. concomitant aspirin or NSAIDs or alcohol | 1 |
| Maximum Score | 2 |

## CHOICE OF ANTI-COAGULATION:
*   Vitamin K antagonist
    *   Aim for INR 2-3
*   Assess risk of bleeding
*   Take measures to reduce/ modify risk of bleeding
*   Dietary modification & regular monitoring

## MEASURES TO REDUCE HIGH BLEEDING RISK:
*   Control SBP to less than 140 mmHg
*   Avoid dietary indiscretions
*   Avoid concomitant aspirin, anti platelets, NSAIDs
*   Avoid alcohol
*   Correct anemia

OAC if score >1 in men and >2 in women

Bleeding Risk High in score >3

## HEART RATE CONTROL
In all patients except hemodynamic instability
Beta blocker or calcium blocker or combination
BB + digoxin in HF
Rate aim to be less than 110/min
CONVERSION TO NSR
Patients' preference
Hemodynamic instability
Uncontrolled symptoms despite HR control
Unacceptable rate control drug side effects

## MANAGEMENT

### AT PHC/CHC:
*   Detailed clinical evaluation
*   Basic investigations
*   Careful ECG evaluation
*   Start OAC if indicated (based on Stroke risk)
*   Start Metoprolol if HR >110/min & no evidence of CHF
*   Refer if indicators for early intervention

### AT DISTRICT HOSPITAL:
*   Admit if indicators of early interventions
*   Immediate cardioversion after heparinization,if hemodynamic instability
*   Manage precipitating factors if any
*   Assess stroke, bleeding risk & coagulation parameters
*   Detailed echocardiogram
*   Start OAC, maintain INR around 2-3
*   Control HR by single drug or combination of BB & Ca Blocker
*   Refer HR uncontrolled or CHF or angina

### AT TERTIARY CENTRE:
*   Re-assess clinical status, adequacy of AC
*   Consider need of NOAC
*   Optimise management of underlying cardiac disease
*   Stress life style and AF risk factor modification
*   Assess need for rhythm control and discuss pros & cons
*   Consider RFA in select patient

### BASIC INVESTIGATIONS:
*   Hemograms
*   Blood sugar, Creatinine
*   Electrolytes
*   12 lead ECG

### DESIRABLE INVESTIGATIONS:
*   Plain X-ray chest
*   Thyroid evaluation
*   Liver function test
*   Troponins
*   Prothrombin time, INR (Coagulation profile)
*   Echocardiography

### OPTIONAL INVESTIGATIONS:
*   Prolonged ECG monitoring
*   Trans-esophagial echocardiography
*   Exercise Stress Test
*   CT scan
*   MRI
*   EP study
*   Coronary angiography

### WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN ECG ?
*   Ventricular rate
*   Chamber enlargement
*   Pre-excitation
*   Prior MI
*   Bundle branch block
*   QT interval

### RHYTHM CONTROL

#### Pharmacological Cardioversion

*   CHF
    *   CAD
    *   Amiodarone
    *   Abnormal LVH
*   Normal Heart
    *   Flecainide
    *   Ibutilide
    *   Propafenone
*   Pill in pocket
    *   Flecainide
    *   Propafenone

#### Long Term Rhythm Control
*   Normal Heart
    *   Flecainide
    *   Propafenone
    *   Sotalol
*   CHF
    *   Amiodarone
*   CAD, LVH
    *   Amiodarone
    *   Sotalol
