# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
EMPYEMA THORACIS IN CHILDREN
ICD-10-J86

## CLINICAL FEATURES

### SYMPTOMS
*   Fever
*   Chest pain
*   Cough
*   Respiratory distress
*   Abdominal pain and vomiting

### SIGNS
*   Auscultation -
    decreased breath
    sounds & crackles
*   Dullness to percussion

## DEFINITION
Presence of pus or
microorganism in the
pleural fluid, observed on
smear examination or on
culture.
*   Criteria for diagnosis in the
absence of microorganism:
    *   (a) **Pleural fluid pH< 7.0**
    *   (b) **Lactic
        dehydrogenase (LDH)
        > 1000 IU/L**
    *   (c) **Glucose <40 mg/dL**
        or
    *   (d) **Lactate > 5 mol/L or
        45 mg/dL**

## CAUSE OF EMPYEMA
*   **Bacterial pneumonia** (develop in 50-70% cases
    of complicated pneumonia)
*   **Tubercular empyema**
*   **Chest wall trauma**
*   **Lung Abscess/Aspiration**
*   Common organisms: **S pneumoniae, S aureus**,
    and **group A streptococci**

## PHASES OF EMPYEMA
The treatment depends on the stage of
empyema
*   Exudative phase (1-3days)
*   Fibrino-purulent phase (4-14days)
*   Organising phase (>14days)
*   Any child with diagnosed pneumonia with no
    improvement and spiking fever after 48 hours
    of antibiotic treatment may signal empyema

## INVESTIGATIONS:
*   **Blood**: Blood counts, Blood Culture, ASO Titre, CRP
*   **Sputum**: Sputum AFB, Gram Staining and Culture
*   **Radiological:**
    *   **Chest X-ray**: PA. Obliteration of Costophrenic angle or
        Meniscus sign are early signs of pleural effusion.
    *   **USG Chest**: Amount of fluid & echogenicity of fluid,
        loculation and pleural thickening. It can be a guide for
        thoracocentesis or ICD placement.
    *   **CT Chest**: Role only in complicated cases and to detect
        underlying lung problems. HRCT is ideal before surgery
*   **Pleural fluid Analysis**:
    *   Microbiology - Gram stain, Culture (aerobic & anaerobic)
    *   Cytology to see for type of cells
    *   Biochemistry- LDH, PH, Glucose

## TREATMENT
*   Child not sick; investigation
    reveals a small effusion- **IV fluids**,
    **Oxygen**, **IV Antibiotics**, **Analgesics**
*   Child looks sick; investigation
    reveals larger effusions &
    respiratory compromise -
    **IV Antibiotics** and **Intercostal
    Chest tube Drainage**
*   **Antibiotics** : **3rd Gen
    Cephalosporins/Extended
    Penicillins like Co-Amoxiclav**, for
    1-4 weeks
    Change based on cultures,
    Continue until afebrile/ICD
    removed

## ICD INSERTION
*   Adequate sized tubes under **USG**
    guidance preferably in the mid
    axillary line through the safe
    triangle under **IV** sedation for
    children with adequate
    monitoring
*   If **USG** is not available: needle
    aspiration, confirmation of pus
    and insertion of tube maybe
    done
*   Maximum fluid to be drained:
    *   10ml/kg in small children
    *   1.5 litres in older children
*   Tube to be removed at complete
    clinical resolution or changed
    when blocked

## ROLE OF SURGERY
*   Thoracoscopy if facilities available
*   If not, thoracotomy
*   Indications for surgery:
    1.  **Failure of ICD, Antibiotics**
    2.  **Persisting sepsis beyond 7 days of
        antibiotics, pleural collection despite
        chest tube drainage or complex or
        delayed empyema (with loculation)**

## THORACOSCOPY VS THORACOTOMY

### THORACOSCOPY
*   Preferred in early
    empyema
*   Breakdown of loculi
*   Complete pus drainage
*   Debridement under vision
*   Full lung expansion
*   If peel is very thick and not
    amenable for removal,
    should be converted to
    thoracotomy

### THORACOTOMY
*   Formal Thoracotomy and
    Decortication indicated in **Stage 3**
    and delayed cases where there is
    *   Thick peel
    *   Thick pyogenic material
    *   Inability to develop a pleural
        window
    *   Complex and chronic
        empyema
    *   Underlying diseased lung

## FIBRINOLYTICS IN STAGE II EMPYEMA
*   Safe and cost effective treatment
    modality that avoids surgery
*   **Indications**
    *   Within 2 weeks duration
    *   Preferably no ICD has been placed
    *   Imaging shows echogenic collection
        with septation
    *   Fluid analysis shows frank
        pus/exudative effusion
*   **CONTRAINDICATIONS**
    *   Bleeding diathesis
    *   Suspected TB
    *   Hypersensitivity to fibrinolytic
    *   Complicated pneumonia/ lung abscess
    *   Air leak on insertion of ICD

## PROCEDURE
*   16/18 size ICD tube inserted under sedation with local
    anesthesia, towards marked point of maximal collection
    and connected to underwater seal without any suction
*   Assessed after 24 hours, no further intervention if
    afebrile, without distress and effusion cleared on Xray

## ALGORITHM OF MANAGEMENT OF CHILDHOOD EMPYEMA

```mermaid

    A[Suspected empyema - X ray Chest - suggests significant effusion] --> B{Chest USG for
quantifying
effusion};
    B -- No effusion
- treat as
pneumonia --> C[treat as pneumonia];
    B -- Effusion
present --> D[Paediatric surgery
consultation for ICD
insertion or refer to
higher center];

    D --> F{Stage 2 or 3 complex effusion};
    E --> G[ICD/Aspiration/Antiobiotcs];
    F --> H[CECT & VATS. If thick peel: thoracotomy];
