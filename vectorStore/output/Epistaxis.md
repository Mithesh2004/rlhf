## CLINICAL SCENARIOS
*   Acute bleeding from the nose after physical trauma/barotrauma/ nose picking/ physical exertion.
*   Acute bleeding from the nose in hypertensive / hematological disorders.
*   Acute bleeding from the nose without any obvious cause.

## ESSENTIAL CLINICAL EXAMINATION

### ESSENTIAL
*   Local examination by anterior rhinoscopy/ endoscopy to look for source of bleeding (scanty/moderate).
    *   Little's area bleeder/clot/congestion
    *   Sharp septal spur
    *   Congested nasal mucosa as in URTI
*   General physical examination to evaluate other systems (Cardiovascular/Lower Respiratory/Neurological) clinically.

### SYSTEMIC ASSESSMENT
Screen for coagulation disorders/ anticoagulant medications/ hematological malignancies

## MANAGEMENT

### STEP-WISE MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLE
1.  Ensure patent airway/ avoid aspiration by head down/lateral positioning
2.  Restore hemodynamic stability by intravenous fluid replacement/transfusion
3.  Control bleeding/bleeder by
    *   Bidigital compression of nose for 10 minutes in Trotter's position (cotton pledgets soaked in 4% xylocaine with adrenaline may be used)
    *   Short term tab labetalol will take care of uncontrolled hypertension
    *   Chemical/electrocauterization of bleeder in Little's area
4.  Tamponade of bleeders by anterior nasal packing/epistaxis balloon
5.  Poterior nasal packing if bleeding is not controlled with above measures
6.  Antibiotic prophylaxis and hospitalizarion is recommended after nasal packing
7.  H2blockers/ PPI to be given in case of blood aspiration to avoid gastritis
8.  Persisting bleeding despite nasal packing > consider arterial ligation (sphenopalatine/ anterior ethmoidal artery).
9.  Selective embolization is an alternative to surgery
10. Address identified etiology, if any

## INVESTIGATIONS

### ESSENTIAL
1.  Hemoglobin level
2.  Coagulation profile
3.  Complete blood count

### DESIRABLE
CT scan with contrast in cases with no obvious cause// suspected benign or malignant lesion

#### RED FLAG SIGNS
*   Features suggestive of neoplasia
    *   Unilateral bleeding
    *   Nasal obstruction
    *   Visual/orbital symptoms
    *   Obvious mass lesion
*   Persistent bleeding despite nasal packing
*   Altered blood counts/coagualtion profile
*   Recurrent profuse bleeding
*   Consider JNA in teenage boys
*   Aneurysmal bleeding (specially following trauma) to be ruled out by DSA
*   To be managed by appropriate treatment at tertiary level

## FOLLOW UP SERVICES
1.  Continued nasal lubrication for 2 weeks with liquid paraffin
2.  Repeat anterior rhinoscopy/endoscopy to know/confim the cause of bleeding
3.  Oral hematinics to be considered if needed

## QUALITY ASSESSMENT PARAMETERS
1.  Recurrence of episodes
2.  Improvement in hemoglobin level over a period of time.

## POINTS TO PONDER WHILE MANAGING EPISTAXIS
1.  Epistaxis in children is almost always anterior and from Little's area, consequent to mucosal drying by dry air.
2.  Epistaxis in adults is often related to hypertension and arises posteriorly from the posterior end of inferior turbinate
3.  Initial non-invasive methods may suffice in a large majority of patients.

## ABBREVIATIONS
*   JNA: Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma
*   DSA: Digital Subtraction Angiography
*   CT: Computerized Tomograms
*   URTI: Upper Respiratory Tract Infection
