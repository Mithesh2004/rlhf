# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**INTRAOCULAR TUBERCULOSIS**
ICD-10-A18.3

When to suspect
*   Ocular Symptoms
    *   Blurred vision
    *   Redness
    *   Photophobia
    *   Pain in the eye
    *   Floaters
    *   Flashes of lights

Refer to Ophthalmologist for detailed examination

Eye Care facility should have:
Mandatory: Slit lamp, ophthalmoscope (direct or indirect), intraocular
pressure assessment device
Preferred: Fundus camera, Fundus
fluorescein angiongram(FFA), Optical
Coherence Tomography (OCT)

Examination of the eyes
*   Clinical signs
    *   Assess visual acuity
    *   Anterior chamber cells, **Keratic precipitates**, **Synechiae**,
    *   Irregular pupil, **RAPD**
    *   Complicated **cataract**, high or very low **intraocular pressure**
    *   **Vitritis**, **Pars plana exudates**, **Retinal vasculitis**, **Retinitis**,
    *   **Choroiditis**, **Optic nerve head swelling**

**Granulomatous anterior uveitis**
**Intermeditate uveitis**
**Panuveitis/Posterior uveitis**
**Retinal vasculitis**
**Choroiditis**

INVESTIGATIONS
*   Essential:
    *   **CXR for healed/ active pulmonary TB**
*   Desirable:
    *   **Mantoux Test (standardised tuberculin units): 10 mm induration considered positive**
*   Optional:
    *   **CT Chest (if available) for healed/active pulmonary TB**

*   Imaging of eye: Ascertaining diagnosis, extent of disease & follow up, teleconsultation

    *   Retinal photographs using fundus camera
    *   Optical coherence tomography scans (if available)
    *   Fluorescein angiograms (if available)

*   Investigations to rule out other causes of clinical presentation

MANAGEMENT
TREATMENT
*   **ATT**: 2 months of RHEZ + 7 months of RH depending on clinical response & side effects to treatment
*   Add pyridoxine 10 mg/day
*   Corticosteroids : Topical steroids eye drops for severe/anterior chamber inflammation
*   For treatment in children refer to paediatrician
*   Systemic corticosteroids for severe inflammation in consultation with Uveitis expert

REFERRAL TO HIGHER CENTRE
*   Not confident to treat
*   Vision threatening
*   Non-response to treatment
*   Side effects due to treatment
*   Atypical reaction

MONITORING AND FOLLOW UP
*   Frequency of follow up: 1-2 weeks in 1st month followed by monthly for 3 months & then 3 monthly
*   Eye: Clinical grading of inflammation using fundus photographs & OCT scans (if available)
*   Steroids:
    *   Topical: Monitor **IOP**, **cataract** and any signs of bacterial/ fungal infection
    *   Systemic steroids: Monitor body weight, blood sugar & blood pressure

ABBREVIATIONS
*   ATT: Antitubercular treatment
*   E: Ethambutol
*   H: Isoniazid
*   IOP: Intraocular pressure
*   R: Rifampicin
*   RAPD: Relative Afferent Pupilary Defect
*   OCT: Optical coherence tomography
*   Z: Pyrazinamide
