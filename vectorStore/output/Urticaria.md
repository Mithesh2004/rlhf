# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
URTICARIA AND ANGIOEDEMA
ICD-10-L50.9

## URTICARIA-CLINICAL APPEARANCE
*   Urticaria -sudden appearance of **wheals, angioedema**, or both
    *   A **wheal**- A sharply circumscribed superficial central swelling of variable size and shape, surrounded by reflex erythema
    *   Associated with itching/burning sensation and of fleeting nature- resolves within 1-24 hours
    *   Chronic urticaria implies duration for more than 6 weeks
*   **Angioedema**
    *   Sudden, pronounced, erythematous or skin-colored swelling of lower dermis and subcutis with frequent involvement of mucous membranes
    *   Associated pain, rather than itching/resolution is slower and can take up to 72 hours

## CLASSIFICATION OF CHRONIC URTICARIA SUBTYPES
(presenting with wheals, angioedema, or both)

| Chronic spontaneous | Inducible (mostly physical) |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| *   Spontaneous appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both for ≥6 weeks | *   Symptomatic dermographism |
|                    | *   Delayed pressure urticaria |
|                    | *   Cholinergic urticaria |
|                    | *   Cold/Heat urticaria |
|                    | *   Solar urticaria |
|                    | *   Aquagenic urticaria |
|                    | *   Contact urticaria |

## HISTORY
*   Time to onset
*   Frequency/duration
*   Diurnal variation
*   Associated **angioedema**
*   Associated pain, itch
*   Induction by physical agents or exercise
*   Family history
*   Previous allergies
*   Surgical implantations
*   Gastric/intestinal problem
*   Drug history
*   Correlation with food
*   Correlation with menses
*   Smoking
*   Work profile
*   Hobbies
*   Stress
*   Quality of life impact
*   Response to therapy

## EXAMINATION
*   Due to evanescent nature the examination may not show any lesions
*   Presence of wheals of various sizes and shapes
*   The lesions are non-scaly but show an intense erythema and a trailing clearing region in older areas which may lead to a target configuration in expanding plaques

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES OF URTICARIA
*   Insect/Bedbug bites
*   Urticarial vasculitis- painful, persist for 24-48 hours and fade to leave bruising; + fever and arthralgia
*   Pre bullous phase of bullous pemphigoid
*   Maculopapular drug/viral rash

## INVESTIGATIONS
Generally, no investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis

### INVESTIGATIONS
*   Skin biopsy may be indicated if other diagnoses are being suspected
*   C4 and C1 inhibitor quantitation to detect Cl inhibitor deficiency may be done in suspected hereditary angioedema (Angioedema without urticaria)
*   Tests for current or past viral, bacterial or parasitic infections should be guided by history and clinical findings
*   Lab tests may be needed if patient is planned for immunosuppressive treatment
*   Certain investigations that are often ordered, but are of limited utility
    *   Thyroid function tests and antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies
    *   Autologous serum skin test (ASST)
    *   Skin prick/specific IgE test

### GENERAL PRINCIPLES
*   Reassure -remits spontaneously in 12-24 months in ~50% patients
*   Treat with antihistamines. Reassure that prolonged treatment with long-acting, non-sedating antihistamines is not harmful
*   Non-sedating antihistamines (e.g. **Cetirizine** 10mg, **Levocetirizine** 5mg, **Loratadine** 10mg, or **Fexofenadine** 180mg once daily) mainstay of treatment. Dose can be increased 4-fold safely if needed
*   Long-term first generation antihistamines e.g. **Chlorphenamine**, **Hydroxyzine** avoided if possible due to risk of sedation and psychomotor impairment
*   Avoid triggers including drugs such as NSAIDs, PCM, ACE inhibitors if history is suggestive of drug induced or exacerbated urticaria/ angioedema

## TREATMENT

### TREATMENT OF URTICARIA/ANGIOEDEMA AT PRIMARY CARE LEVEL

    A[First Line: 2nd generation non-sedating antihistamines] --> B{If symptoms persist after 2 weeks};
    B --> C[Second Line: Increase dosage (upto fourfold) of 2nd generation antihistamines];
    C --> D{If symptoms persist after 2-4 further weeks};
    D --> E[Refer to higher centre];
```
*   Severe urticaria with respiratory distress- maintain airway; injectable Hydrocortisone and Pheniramine (Avil) may be required
*   Intra-muscular Adrenaline of 1:1000 dilution (1 mg in 1 mL), 0.2 to 0.5 mg (0.01 mg/kg in children; maximum dose: 0.3 mg) administered intramuscularly every 5 to 15 minutes if choking/respiratory distress/shock
*   Angioedema with respiratory or laryngeal symptom requires emergency management -refer to higher center after vital stabilization; oral Prednisolone may be initiated to take care of biphasic response

### MANAGEMENT AT SECONDARY CARE LEVEL

```
*   Patients whose urticaria is difficult to control with antihistamines despite fourfold higher dosage than the licensed doses of Cetirizine, Levocetirizine or Fexofenadine
*   Patients with polypharmacy
*   Unusual urticaria e.g. long lasting lesions >24-48 hours with bruising
*   Associate angioedema that is unresponsive or presents with choking/ dyspnoea
*   Investigations not available

### MANAGEMENT AT TERTIARY CARE LEVEL

    B --> C[Second Line: Increase dosage (upto fourfold) of 2nd generation antihistamines];

    D --> E[Third line: Add on to second line Omalizumab (300mg s/c every 4 weeks) or Cyclosporine A or Montelukast Short course (max 10 days) of corticosteroids #];
```
#Oral or injectable conticosteroids are generally not used, except in uncontrolled disease or with associated respiratory symtoms
URTICARIA TREATMENT GOAL IS DISEASE REMISSION-NOT CURE
