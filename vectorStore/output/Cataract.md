# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## CATARACT
ICD-10-H25.9

### SYMPTOMS
Decrease in vision, progressive
change in power of glasses,
glare, uniocular polyopia, white
pupillary reflex

### SIGNS
VA ≤ 6/9+, not improving with
pinhole or glasses, along with
lens opacity

### PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION
Torch, distant direct
ophthalmoscopy

### OPHTHALMIC EXAMINATIONS
#### ESSENTIAL
Vision and refraction, intraocular pressure (IOP),
slit lamp examination, pupillary reflexes, pressure
over lacrimal sac area, fundus examination (if
fundus examination is not possible due to dense
cataract then ultrasound B-scan is advisable)

### SYSTEMIC ASSESSMENT
Detailed medical history
including history of allergy
and review of records if
available and assessment of
general health status

#### DESIRABLE
Slit lamp-specular reflection,
ultrasound-B scan (if there is any clinical
indication such as suspected associated
vitreous haemorrhage or retinal
detachment)

### ESSENTIAL INVESTIGATIONS
*   Blood pressure
*   Blood sugar (FBS,
PPBS/RBS)
*   Ophthalmic biometry
(Axial length and
keratometry for IOL power
calculation)

### OPTIONAL
INVESTIGATIONS
*   Xylocaine sensitivity test
dose if h/o allergy
*   Specular microscopy
*   Serology testing**
*   ECG
Other investigations
based on existing ocular
& systemic disease

### DESIRABLE INVESTIGATIONS
*   Lacrimal sac syringing

## CATARACT PRESENT
### INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY
1.  Clinically significant cataract causing visual loss
enough to warrant surgery (BCVA in affected eye <
6/12 or patient feeling visually handicapped even with
BCVA ≥ 6/12). Advanced cataracts with severe visual
loss BCVA <6/60 or worse should be operated on
priority
2.  Clinically significant cataract enough to account for
other visually disturbing symptoms such as glare, loss
of contrast or polyopia which are bothersome
enough for the patient to undergo surgery
3.  Significant cataract hampering visualization of
fundus for examination or treatment of retinal
disorders
4.  Cataract with narrow angle glaucoma where cataract
surgery is required to improve control of IOP

### PROCEED FOR
SURGERY IF INDICATED
Discussion with
patient about
cataract, need for
surgery, possible
surgical options,
expected outcome
and prognosis

Advice for follow
up as needed

### CATARACT WITH OCULAR COMORBIDITY
*   Explain implications of associated
corneal opacity/glaucoma/uveitis/
retinal disease/optic nerve disease/
amblyopia/squint/uncontrolled
systemic disease
*   Prioritize care according to the severity
of the disease and need for treatment
*   Refer to specialist for consultation/
opinion/management and follow up

### CATARACT WITH SYSTEMIC COMORBIDITY
*   **Medicine specialist referral essential:**
    *   Ischaemic heart disease (with request for
monitored anaesthetic care and decision
on withholding
anticoagulant/fibrinolytics)
    *   Systemic malignancy
*   **Medicine specialist referral desirable:**
    *   Hypertension
    *   Diabetes mellitus
    *   Chronic renal disease
    *   Collagen vascular diseases
    *   Thyroid disease

### CATARACT ABSENT
LOOK FOR OTHER
CAUSES OF VISION
IMPAIRMENT AND
REFER AS NECESSARY
*   Corneal pathology
*   Glaucoma
*   Retinal disease
*   Optic nerve disease
*   Amblyopia

### FITNESS FOR SURGERY
*   General health stable
*   BP ≤ 150/90mm Hg
*   Blood sugar (mg/dl) FBS < 150, PPBS < 200 / RBS < 200

### PRE-OPERATIVE PREPARATION
Topical broad spectrum antibiotics,
QID for 1-3 days advisable

Surgery to be performed in sterile OT following strict
aseptic procedures and universal precautions.

### SURGICAL PREPARATION
Periocular cleaning with 10% povidone
iodine followed by instillation of 5% povidone iodine in
conjunctival sac, rinse after 3 minutes. sterile surgical eye drape
to be used

### SURGICAL OPTIONS
1.  Small Incison Cataract Surgery (SICS) with PMMA IOL.
2.  Phacoemulsification (Phaco) with Indian foldable IOL (as per
expertise, feasibility and availability)
3.  Phaco with imported or premium foldable IOL (wherever
indicated, as per expertise, availability and feasibility)
4.  ECCE (large incision) with PMMA IOL

### POST OP CARE
*   Topical broad spectrum antibiotics, QID for 1-2
weeks or longer if required
*   Topical steroids 4-6 times per day for 2 Weeks then
taper over 2-4 weeks
*   Follow up: 1 day, 1-2 weeks (optional) & 2-4 weeks
after cataract surgery
*   Prescription of glasses at 2-4 weeks after cataract
surgery
*   Refer to higher centre in case of adverse event

### CATARACT WITH
CO-MORBIDITY
### PHC/PRIMARY LEVEL
*   Detailed examination
*   Refraction for BCVA
*   Preliminary diagnosis

### MANAGEMENT
INDICATIONS FOR URGENT REFERRAL :
White cataract, shallow AC, sluggish
pupil, sudden vision loss with cataract,
bilateral advanced cataract.

*   Referral to Ophthalmologist if BCVA, vision with pinhole ≤ 6/12
*   Postoperative follow up and compliance
*   Timely referral in case of drop in vision or development of fresh
symptoms after last follow up visit for post-operative complications
such as PCO(VAO)/CME/Corneal decompensation/raised intraocular
pressure/uveitis/ displaced IOL/delayed endopthalmitis/scleritis/
wound dehiscence etc.

#### SECONDARY LEVEL
*   Cataract surgery
*   Diagnose, manage or refer comorbidities such as Glaucoma, Diabetic
Retinopathy, Corneal opacity, etc.
*   Postoperative follow up, refraction and ensure compliance
*   Manage PCO(VAO)/other complications or refer

#### TERTIARY LEVEL
*   Cataract surgery
*   Diagnose and manage comorbidities such as Glaucoma, Diabetic
Retinopathy, Corneal opacity, etc.
*   Postoperative follow up, refraction and ensure compliance
*   Manage PCO/VAO/other complications

### QUALITY ASSESSMENT PARAMETERS TO BE RECORDED
*   Patient identifiers (age, gender, address)
*   Preoperative vision, diagnosis of the eye to be operated
*   Date of surgery, procedure name, implanted IOL
*   Follow up vision
*   Post operative visit date (2-4 weeks post op visit), refractive status
*   Cause of BCVA ≤ 6/12
*   Positive indicator :BCVA ≥ 6/9 at 2-4 weeks or regains full visual potential
*   Negative indicator: vision worse than pre-op or unexplained lack of improvement or
serious complications (endophthalmitis/irreversible corneal decompensation/dropped
nucleus/IOL dislocation/resurgery)

*If vision does not improve with refraction, a clinical assessment must be made to assess if this is purely due to cataract, or ocular co-morbidity such as corneal pathology, glaucoma, retinal disease, optic nerve
pathology or amblyopia. A decision must be taken based on history and clinical features and further referral to higher centre if necessary.
* Any patient with cataract and BCVA < 6/12 in better eye qualifies is visually impaired and should be offered surgery.
* Patients with cataract and BCVA ≥ 6/12 may also be offered surgery depending on symptoms and visual needs.
** A risk assessment by history and review of any risk factors for possible carrier of transmissible diseases such as HIV/HBsAg/HCV should be done and serology testing may be done if any risk factor is identified. In
general, standard universal precautions must be taken in all cases.
