# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of OTORRHOEA
ICD-10-H92.10

## CLINICAL SCENARIOS

### DISEASES OF EXTERNAL EAR
*   Serous/purulent discharge with significant tenderness of external ear amidst edema (localized-pus: **furunculosis** or generalized: **Acute otitis externa** denoting Staph/ Pseudomonas infection)
*   Thick discharge with itching usually in hot/ humid climate: **Otomycosis** (Candida- white spores; Aspergillus- black spores) [Fig 2]
*   Scanty serous discharge & itching with desquamated debris in ear canal **Eczematous otitis externa (EAC)**

### DISEASES OF MIDDLE EAR
*   **URI** with severe ear pain (manifested in children as inconsolable crying and ear tugging), relieved with episode of mucopurulent blood stained otorrhoea: **Resolving AOM** [Fig 3]
*   Mucopurulent otorrhoea from perforated tympanic membrane
    *   Active: otorrohoea
    *   Inactive: no otorrhoea
    *   Safe type: central perforation [Fig 4A] and total perforation [Fig 4B]
    *   Unsafe type: cholesteatoma [Fig 5A] and granulation [Fig 5B]
*   Recurrent painless profuse mucopurulent discharge with pale granulations/multiple perforations unresponsive to antibiotics: **Tubercular otitis media** should be suspected and needs biopsy
*   Bloody otorrhoea following **Trauma**: **Traumatic perforation**
*   Acute onset bloody discharge with neural deficits/ neck nodes: Neoplasm
*   Watery otorrhoea (may be associated with trauma): **CSF Otorrhoea**

**FIGURES**

1: Furunculosis
2: Otomycosis
3: Resolving AOM
4A: Safe CSOM (central perforation)
4B: Safe CSOM (subtotal perforation)
5A: Unsafe CSOM (cholesteatoma)
5B: Unsafe CSOM (granulation)
6: Traumatic Perforation

### CLINICAL EXAMINATIONS
*   Otoscopy as a part of Complete ENT examination by primary physician (Tele-otoscopy interpreted by physician)
*   Hearing evaluation by conversation/ whisper/ Tuning forks tests
*   General and systemic clinical examination

### INVESTIGATIONS
*   Routine investigations i.e Total and differential leucocyte count, ESR
*   RBS (Random blood sugar, fasting and postprandial)
*   CT/MRI in suspected complications
*   Biopsy nasopharynx (To rule out nasopharyngeal enlargement in unsafe CSOM)
*   Culture & sensitivity of aural discharge

### RED FLAGS FOR REFERRAL TO DISTRICT LEVEL
*   Periaural abscess or cellulitis
*   High grade fever, dizziness and toxic appearance
*   Severe headache with neck stiffness/vomiting/ altered sensorium.
*   Facial palsy/ Neurological defecits
*   Diabetic with severe deep seated ear pain / neural defecits (**Skull base osteomyelitis**)
*   Physical trauma with bloody/watery discharge (suspected CSF leak)
*   Suspected tuberculosis/ neoplasm

## MANAGEMENT

### PHC / PRIMARY LEVEL
*   **Acute otitis externa**: Oral **Ciprofloxacin/Amoxycillin clavulanic acid combination** for 7-10 days (2 weeks maximum) and analgesics. **Ichthammol gycerine (1:9) packing of EAC** in moderate to severe edema. Refer pus pointing furuncle to DH
*   **Otomycosis**: Cleaning and **Clotrimazole ear drops**
*   **Eczematous otitis externa**: **Ciprofloxacin ear drops** with steroid combination.
*   **AOM / Resolving AOM**: Oral **amoxicillin / Erythromycin / Clarithromycin** for 10 days. With no response in 3 days start **Amoxycillin clavulanic acid combination** for 10 days. Refer to DH if no resolution
*   Inactive CSOM: Referral to DH for surgery.
*   Active CSOM: **Ciprofloxacin ear drops** with dry mopping & referral to DH for surgery. A course of oral antibiotics maybe prescribed in ase of persistant otorrhoea after topical antibiotics
*   Traumatic perforation: Topical antibiotics for otorrhoea if any and maintain ear dry till healing complete
*   In case of suspicion of complications start intravenous **Amoxycillin clavulanic acid combination** and refer to DH

### DISTRICT HOSPITAL
*   Surgical interventions except neurosurgical interventions (eg I&D, tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy)
*   Biopsy in suspected neoplasm
*   Medical management of medical co-morbidities such as diabetes, tuberculosis, meningismus/ meningitis

### TERTIARY LEVEL
*   Surgical management particularly of intracranial complications including neurosurgical interventions

*   Patient to be educated for proper technique of ear mopping, contralateral lie (10 min) following instillation of drops & avoiding water entry e.g ear-plugs during bathing
*   To ensure adequate immunization (measles/ H.Influenza/ Pneumococcus) in recurrent AOM and to adopt correct posture during breastfeeding while avoiding bottle feeding
*   Pus culture sensitivity to guide antibiotic regime in recurrent/complicated cases
*   Patient education to refrain from indigenous (oil/ hot water/ acid etc) ear treatments

**KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES**
