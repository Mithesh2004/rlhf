# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of **CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD)**
October/2019

ICD-10-N18.3

## WHAT IS CKD?

Abnormalities of
kidney structure or
function, present for >3
months, with
implications for health

## WHEN TO LOOK FOR CKD
*   History of long-standing nocturia, or constitutional symptoms
*   Edema, hematuria, proteinuria or renal stones
*   Long-term intake of painkillers or herbal medicines
*   Family history of kidney disease
*   Growth retardation, rickets, or proximal myopathy
*   Unexplained hypertension or anemia
*   Longstanding diabetes, hypertension, CVD, stroke, PVD
*   Systemic diseases (e.g. connective tissue disease)

## EVALUATION OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED PATIENT WITH CKD
*   Serum creatinine, electrolytes, bicarbonate
*   Estimate **glomerular filtration rate** using **CKD-EPI** equation
*   Urinalysis (examine sediment, proteinuria quantitation)
*   Ultrasound of kidneys and urinary tract
*   Calcium, phosphate, alkaline phoshatase, albumin
*   CBC including peripheral blood film
*   Iron profile - Serum iron, TIBC, TSAT
*   HBsAg, anti-HCV

## INITIAL ASSESSMENT FOR
*   Confirmation of CKD diagnosis (repeat tests after 3 months)
*   Staging and progression rate
*   Establishing cause of kidney disease
*   Identify and treat reversible factors (hypertension, volume loss, obstruction, infection)
*   Look for complications (anemia, bone disease, dyselectrolytemias, CVD)

## LIFESTYLE MEASURES FOR ALL CKD PATIENTS:
*   Weight control/ weight gain monitoring in children
*   Regular physical activity
*   Reduce dietary salt intake to < 5 g/day
*   Stop tobacco use in all forms
*   Stop/moderate alcohol use
*   Stop using unproven health supplements
*   Do not use NSAIDS
*   Avoid untested indigenous medicines

## BP CONTROL (TARGET <130/80, 120/80 IF PROTEINURIA)
*   Restrict dietary salt to < 5 g/day
*   Use any anti-HT available in local pharmacy
*   Diuretics - eGFR > 45: thiazide, <45 ml/min: furosemide; <30 ml/min: do not use potassium sparing agents
*   ACEI/ARB preferred* for proteinuric patients (> 1 g/d)
*   *caution/do not use if eGFR <30 ml/min, or Potassium >5.5 mEq/L

## VACCINATION SCHEDULE FOR NEWLY DIAGNOSED CKD PATIENT
*   If HBV -ve: 20 µg IM in each deltoid at 0,1,2 and 6 months
*   In children - complete primary vaccination schedule

## ANEMIA MANAGEMENT
*   Establish iron replete state
*   If not iron replete, give oral iron
*   Consider IV iron for dialysis patients and those not tolerating orally
*   If Hb still <8 g/dl - start erythropoietin, titrate to Hb 10-11 g/dl

## MANAGEMENT OF HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA (P04>5.5)
*   Start with Ca-containing binders
*   Non Ca-binders can be used if serum Ca >9 mg/dl, vascular calcification or low iPTH

## DIABETES CONTROL (TARGET HBA1C <7%)
*   Do not use metformin if eFGR <30

## NUTRITION
*   Salt restriction < 5g/d. Protein 0.6-0.8 g/kg/day.
*   DO NOT restrict proteins unless documented high protein user (dairy, white meat are good protein sources, mix different types of dal).
*   Restrict green leafy vegetables if eGFR <30 ml/min
*   Avoid fruit juices, coconut water and carbonated beverages
*   For children: ensure adequate protein intake appropriate for age.

## LOW POTASSIUM FRUITS/ VEGETABLES:
Apple, pineapple, papaya, pear,
tangerine, watermelon, grape,
plum, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower,
onion, radish, peppers, chillies,
brinjal, cucumber, green beans,
peas, rice, bread

## VITAMIN D THERAPY
*   Supplement 60,000 units cholecalciferol q2W
*   Correction of acidosis with oral sodium bicarbonate
*   Activated vitamin D if hyperparathyroidism

## PRIMARY CARE
*   Detailed history and physical examination
*   Identify and correct reversible factors
*   Stop nephrotoxic agents
*   Referral after stabilization

## ADMISSION CRITERIA
*   Initial evaluation or when patient presents with specific problems - like acute worsening, development of a new complication
*   For creation of vascular access
*   For PD catheter placement or initiation
*   Initiation on HD and for kidney transplant

## TERTIARY CARE
*   Detailed history and physical examination
*   Investigate to ascertain cause of CKD (imaging/biopsy/genetic studies)
*   Tailor treatment to cause
*   Identify and manage complications
*   Vaccination
*   Counseling: nutrition, lifestyle, pregnancy in women of child-bearing age
*   Discussion regarding RRT
*   Vascular access creation/PD catheter insertion
*   Work-up for transplantation
*   Send patient back to community with treatment plan

## MANAGEMENT
## INDICATIONS FOR REFERRAL
*   Initial evaluation of all newly diagnosed cases
*   Rapid disease progression
*   New complication
*   Discussion for Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)

## DISTRICT HOSPITAL
*   Detailed history and physical examination
*   Investigate to ascertain cause of CKD
*   Tailor treatment to cause
*   Identify and manage complications
*   Vaccination
*   Identify and correct acute factors
*   Counseling: nutrition, lifestyle, pregnancy in women of child-bearing age
*   Discussion regarding RRT
*   Vascular access creation or PD Catheter insertion
*   Send patient back to community with treatment plan

## PREPARATION FOR RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY
*   eGFR < 30: Preserve veins in the non-dominant arm for AV Fistula
*   eGFR < 30: discuss RRT options.
*   eGFR < 15: May need dialysis soon, counsel for AV fistula, list for transplant
*   Dialysis start: depends on symptoms or eGFR <5 ml/min
*   Look for contraindications to HD or PD: discuss choice in those suitable for either

## CONSERVATIVE CARE
*   If life expectancy limited, multiple comorbidities/personal preference
*   Decision-making should be shared with patient/family

**KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES**
