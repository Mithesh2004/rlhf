# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
ACUTE GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED IN ADULTS - PART B
ICD-10-K92.2

INTERVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT

## UPPER GI ENDOSCOPY (UGIE)

### PORTAL HYPERTENSION (PHT)

* **ESOPHAGEAL VARICES:**
    *   Variceal band ligation is preferable
    *   Sclerotherapy if band ligation not feasible/ available
* **FUNDAL VARICES:**
    *   0.5 - 1 mL of **Cyanoacrylate** glue injection per varix

### GASTRIC OR DUODENAL ULCER

* **ULCER WITH ACTIVE SPURT/SLOW OOZING/VISIBLE VESSEL:**
    *   Inject around the ulcer 1:10000 **Adrenaline** diluted in saline + hemoclips/thermal device (APC/ electrocoagulation)

### PRESENTATION WITH HEMATOCHEZIA OR MELENA (BUT NO HEMATEMESIS) AND UGIE IS NORMAL

* **IF ACTIVE LOWER GI BLEEDING:**
    *   After stabilisation, if facility for colonoscopy available:
        *   Prepare bowel with **polyethylene glycol** solution before colonoscopy
        *   Hemostasis can be achieved as in UGI bleeding
    *   If colonoscopy is normal, consider small bowel evaluation
    *   If facility for colonoscopy not available:
        *   Stabilise & refer to a centre with facility for surgery and colonoscopy

### FURTHER MANAGEMENT

*   LFT and viral markers
    *   USG abdomen
    *   Try to ascertain the etiology of portal hypertension
*   Continue vasoactive drugs for total of 5 days in patients with:
    *   Active bleeding on endoscopy
    *   Patients who are Child-Pugh class C status
    *   Received >4 packed red cell transfusions
*   Recommendations for transfusion:
    *   Consider in case of active bleeding
    *   Transfuse platelets if platelet count is <50000/mm³
*   In case of rebleeding:
    *   Try another attempt to control with endotherapy
*   Failure to control bleeding:
    *   Fully covered large bore esophageal metal stent or TIPS

### FURTHER MANAGEMENT

*   Continue PPI infusion for 72 hours
*   Do relook endoscopy after 24 hours
    *   if index endoscopy showed active bleeding and if the endoscopic hemostasis was inadequate
*   If rebleeding:
    *   Try another attempt to control with endotherapy
*   Failure to control bleeding:
    *   Refer to higher centre where surgical treatment is available

### FURTHER MANAGEMENT

*   Continue I.V. antibiotics for 5 days or longer depending on the nature of infection
*   Rebleeding:
    *   Refer to a centre with surgery/ angiography
*   If unidentified source on UGIE and colonoscopy, refer to higher centre

### TREATMENT AT DISCHARGE

*   Propranolol (20 mg) 12 hourly, increase incrementally to achieve a heart rate of 60/min unless contraindicated
*   Repeat endoscopy and assessment for EVL after 2 weeks, continue EVL every 2 to 3 weekly till varices are eradicated.
*   Plan for long term care of patients for underlying liver disease

### TREATMENT AT DISCHARGE

*   Pantoprazole/ Omeprazole (40 mg) twice a day for 4 weeks.
*   Reconsider need for NSAIDs
*   Repeat endoscopy and **H. pylori** testing at 4-6 weeks and appropriate treatment

### TREATMENT AT DISCHARGE

*   In case of infectious etiology continue oral antibiotics for a total of 10-14 days

### DISCHARGE CRITERIA

* Hemodynamically stable
* Heart rate <90/min
* Patient is conscious
* No bleeding for at least the past 72 hours (as indicated by no further fall in hemoglobin)

### RESTARTING OF ANTI PLATELETS/ ANTICOAGULANTS (IF INDICATED)

* After control of bleed: resume low dose Aspirin on day 1
    *   Other antiplatelets/ anticoagulants may be resumed by day 3-5
    *   Consultation with cardiologist should be taken

### ABBREVIATIONS
* APC: Argon plasma coagulation
* EVL: Endoscopic variceal ligation
* GI: Gastrointestinal
* H. pylori: Helicobacter pylori
* LFT: Liver function test
* NSAIDs: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
* PPI: Proton pump inhibitor
* TIPS: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
* USG: Ultrasonography

IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH GI BLEEDING, ENSURE THAT MALIGNANCY HAS BEEN RULED OUT

This STW has been prepared by national experts of India with feasibility considerations for various levels of healthcare system in the country. These broad guidelines are advisory, and are based on expert opinions and available scientific evidence. There may be variations in the management of an individual patient based on his/her specific condition, as decided by the treating physician. There will be no indemnity for direct or indirect consequences. Kindly visit the website of DHR for more information: (stw.icmr.org.in) for more information.
