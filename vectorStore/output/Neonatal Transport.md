*   Neonates with:
    *   **Apnea** or **gasping**
    *   Respiratory distress with retractions or grunt, or not maintaining **SpO2** with oxygen
    *   Persistent **Hypothermia** or **Hyperthermia**
    *   Severe **jaundice** requiring intensive **phototherapy**
    *   **Vomiting** or **abdominal distention**
    *   **Central cyanosis**
    *   Need of positive pressure ventilation>60 seconds at birth
    *   Non-passage of stool or urine for more than 24 hours after birth
    *   **Shock** (Cold periphery with CFT > 3 seconds, and weak/fast pulse)
    *   Refusal to feed, less movement, abnormal movements
    *   **Significant bleeding**

### SNCU TO NICU
*   Birth weight <1000 grams and/or gestational age < 28 weeks
*   Neonates with:
    *   Respiratory distress requiring **mechanical ventilation**
    *   **Unresponsive shock**
    *   Jaundice requiring exchange transfusion, if facility is not available
    *   **Refractory seizures**
    *   Need for surgical intervention
    *   Birth asphyxia qualifying for **therapeutic hypothermia**
    *   **Multiorgan failure**
    *   **Refractory hypoglycemia**
    *   **Acute kidney injury needing dialysis**

## PREPAREDNESS AND PRE-TRANSPORT STABILIZATION
*   Identify and communicate with the referral facility
*   Check availability of the services and bed in the referral facility (e.g. **Ventilator**)
*   Explain the condition of the patient, need for transport to higher facility, the expected plan and prognosis to the family
*   Discuss with parents the possible expenses
*   Take informed consent of the parents prior to transport
*   Share the contact numbers of both referring and the receiving facility including the concerned doctor
*   Enclose (1) Complete summary (2) All investigations (3) Mother's blood sample
*   Identify the transport team with appropriate skilled persons
*   Ensure the logistics and the vehicle are organised
*   If shock present - start treatment before transport
*   All doses of antibiotics and drugs should be timed prior to transport
*   Check temperature and blood glucose prior to transport
*   Ensure clear airway, appropriate respiratory support and secure IV access

## MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT DURING TRANSPORT

### MONITORING DURING TRANSPORT
*   Parameters to be monitored: Temperature, Heart rate, Respiratory rate, Air entry, **SpO2**, GI Aspirates, Position of tubes (ET, OG, Catheter, ICD, IV cannula), Ventilator/ Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) settings
*   Frequency of monitoring: Every 30 minutes depending on the sickness of the baby
*   Communication: Parents and the receiving doctor should be informed of any change in the condition of the baby by the transport team

### MANAGEMENT DURING TRANSPORT
*   Maintain temperature and warmth (incubator / clothing / Kangaroo Mother Care)
*   Position, clear the secretion and assess for need of intubation
*   Assist with appropriate respiratory support (Oxygen, CPAP, Neonatal ventilation). Stop the vehicle if needed for urgent care, e.g. intubation
*   Manage shock by titrating the fluids and inotropes
*   Appropriate quantity, frequency and modality of feeding should be followed during transport (preferably breastfeeding or expressed breastmilk)

## TRANSFER (HANDING OVER) TO THE RECEIVING CENTER BY TRANSPORT TEAM
