# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**NECK SPACE INFECTION**
ICD-10-J36, J39.0, K12.2, J39.1

Rapidly progressive bacterial infections which spread along facial planes and spaces of head and neck region. They may be fatal unless
emergently treated. Most of these infections are secondary to dental infection.

A[Clinical Scenarios] --> B{The typical presentation is with acute onset of pain and swelling in the neck with fever,
malaise, trismus and dysphagia.};
A --> C{Extension along spaces to involve multiple deep neck spaces is frequent and may
extend to parotid space, masticator space, temporal space, visceral vascular
(carotid) space.};
A --> D{Cervical space infection may spread inferiorly to the anterior mediastinum and
posteriorly along prevertebral space.};
A --> E{Tubercular cold abscess involves the same anatomical spaces but would not
display inflammatory signs or rapid progression.};

## CLINICAL SCENARIOS
They usually present as
*   **Ludwig's angina**
    (submandibular space infection)
*   **Peritonsillar abscess**
*   **Parapharyngeal abscess**
*   **Retropharyngeal abscess**

## SYSTEMIC ASSESSMENT
Screen for **diabetes mellitus**, **HIV** infection, **agranulocytosis** and **immunosuppressive therapy** or **chemotherapy**.
Signs of inflammation may be less marked and disease course may be more rapidly progressive in immunocompromised patients.

## CLINICAL EXAMINATION
*   Airway assessment to rule out **stridor** or respiratory compromise
*   Look for signs of **dehydration**
*   Monitor temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, BP, and signs
    of **sepsis/septic shock**.
*   Oral cavity examination to check jaw opening, condition of teeth
    and floor of mouth
*   Oropharyngeal examination to check for inflammed medially
    displaced tonsil & uvula and bulge in lateral pharyngeal wall
*   Palpation of neck for lymph nodes, **cellulitis**, **abscess** or
    subcutaneous **crepitus**
*   Cranial nerve examination to rule out lower cranial nerve palsies

## RED FLAGS FOR REFERRAL TO DISTRICT HOSPITAL
*   **Breathing difficulty**
*   **Trismus**
*   **Torticollis/neck stiffness**
*   Subcutaneous **crepitus** and skin discolouration
    or blisters suggest **necrotizing fibrofascitis**.
*   **Toxaemia**
*   Lower cranial nerve palsy
*   Facial puffiness suggestive of venous
    thrombosis
*   Mediastinal extension

## INVESTIGATIONS
### ESSENTIAL INVESTIGATIONS
1.  **Contrast enhanced CT scan** of head and neck is the standard in evaluation of neck space infections. If **CT Scan** facility is not available, following
    should be done:-
    a.  **Lateral x-ray neck**: Prevertebral soft tissue thickening >7 mm at the level of **C2** or > 2/3rd of the width of the vertebral body at **C6** is highly
        suggestive of **retropharyngeal abscess**. It may also demonstrate foreign bodies, subcutaneous air, air fluid levels and erosion of vertebrae.
    b.  **Ultrasound neck** can suggest **abscess** and guide aspiration attempts.
2.  Blood: **Total and differential leukocyte count, blood sugar, urea**
3.  **Abscess Cultures** with **Gram stain** to direct antimicrobial therapy. **Anaerobic culture**, when available.

| 1. Cautiously assess the  airway. If found  compromised, do  endotracheal intubation/  consider tracheotomy       | 1. Hospitalization: As an emergency for close watch and intensive  management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |  Necrotizing fibrofascitis                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2. Immediately gain an **IV**  access for hydration, broad  spectrum antibiotics and  pain killers.             | 2. Airway management: In progressive disease, in view of impending  airway compromise, consider securing the airway early. During acute  respiratory difficulty, tracheostomy should be done if intubation is  difficult                                                                                                |  Abscess formation                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3. Transfer the patient to  hospital with facility for  surgical drainage                                         | 3. Correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |  No response to antibiotics over  48-72 hours                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Antibiotics: Early and aggressive **IV antibiotic** therapy with a  combination of **Crystalline Penicillin**, **Aminoglycoside** and  **Metronidazole** or **Clindamycin** is preferred.                                                                                                                         |  Deterioration despite antibiotics  over 24 hours                                                                                                                                                                            |

All  other abscesses are drained via an external approach                                                                                                                                                                              |  Airway compromise or impending  airway compromise                                                                                                                                                                            |

## FOLLOW UP SERVICES
Consider cold tonsillectomy for patients with history of multiple
episodes of tonsillar abscess
