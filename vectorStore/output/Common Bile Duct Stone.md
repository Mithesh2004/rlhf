### CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF CBD STONES
**ASYMPTOMATIC/ DETECTED ON WORK UP FOR GALLBLADDER STONES**
```mermaid

    A[WHEN TO SUSPECT CBD STONES IN CASE OF GALL STONE DISEASE
• Deranged LFT
• Dilated CBD on USG
• Raised TLC
• Features of acute cholangitis] --> B(Abdominal pain)
    B --> C{OBSTRUCTIVE JAUNDICE}
    A --> D(Abdominal pain
Fever with chills
Shock)
    D --> E{ACUTE CHOLANGITIS}
    A --> F(Pain typically radiating to back
Increased amylase)
    F --> G{BILIARY PANCREATITIS}
```

### WORK UP OF A PATIENT WITH SUSPECTED CBD STONES
*Palpable Gall bladder with jaundice may be due to malignancy and grossly dilated CBD may be due to choledochal cyst- should be referred to higher centers*

*   **Biochemical investigations**
    *   **Haemogram** (TLC), blood urea, serum creatinine, amylase/lipase
    *   **LFT**- Serum bilirubin, AST/ALT, ALP, PT/INR
    *   Other investigations depending on comorbidities
*   **USG Abdomen**
    *   Gall bladder stones
    *   IHBRD, cholangitic abscess
    *   If CBD stones not seen on USG
*   **MRCP** / **endoscopic USG** - Investigation of choice
    *   Anatomy of biliary tree, IHBRD, stone size, location and CBD diameter
    *   Roadmap for intervention

### MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
