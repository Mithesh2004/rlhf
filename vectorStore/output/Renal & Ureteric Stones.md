# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
RENAL AND URETERIC STONES
ICD N20.0

## HOW WILL YOUR PATIENT PRESENT AND WHAT TO SUSPECT

| CLINICAL SCENARIO | SUSPECT |
|---|---|
| Flank pain | Renal Stone |
| Colicky pain starting from back and radiating to front | Upper ureteric stone |
| Colicky pain starting from back & radiating upto groin | Mid ureteric stone |
| Colicky pain starting from back & radiating to upper thigh & scrotum/vulva | Lower ureteric stone |

SYMPTOMS

### Renal Pelvic Stone
### Upper Ureteric Stone

*   Haematuria may be present with stone at any location
*   Lower ureteric stones may also present with difficulty in passing urine
*   Colics may be associated with nausea and vomiting
*   Can present as **anuria** in bilateral ureteric stones, ureteric stone in a solitary kidney
*   History of site & type of pain, associated symptoms hint towards possible site of stones. Remember to take past history of stone diseases, medications, family history etc

## INVESTIGATION
RADIOLOGY

| NAME | ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES | TIPS FOR ORDERING INVESTIGATIONS |
|---|---|---|
| X-KUB | Readily available, inexpensive, minimal radiation but needs preparation hence may not be the preferred test in emergency settings | Order X-KUB and Ultrasound in all patients of suspected renal stones (90% of renal stones are radio-opaque). |
| USG | Readily available, no radiation, safe test in pregnancy, detects radiolucent stones, high sensitivity for hydronephrosis. Can miss a ureteric calulus | In acute colic NCCT should be preferred if available |
| IVP | Anatomical and functional imaging, aids in planning surgery but high radiation and needs preparation. Not useful in poor renal function | Once the stone is detected, get Intravenous pyelography if stone is seen on X-ray |
| CT Scan | No contrast required, highly sensitive and specific, detect radiolucent stones, detect other causes of flank pain, but risks higher radiation and cost | CT urography if stone is radiolucent to aid further treatment |

### METABOLIC EVALUATION

| Initial biochemical evaluation in all stone formers | Extended Evaluation |
|---|---|
| Urine analysis, serum creatinine, electrolytes namely calcium, phosphorous and uric acid. Intact parathyroid hormone and stone analysis are preferrable | To be done in recurrent stone former, stone in children, bilateral stones, family history of stone, history of gut surgery, solitary kidney and cysteine stones. Typically to be done at 3-4 weeks after stone clearance |
|  | Should include initial metabolic evaluation plus 24-hour urinary levels of calcium,uric acid, and creatinine. Preferable to do urinary oxalate and citrate levels too |

    H --> I[Warning signs for immediate referral];
```

*   Increase daily fluid intake to ensure a urine output >2 lit/day
*   Restrict extra salt intake and increase dietary fibre
*   Do not restrict calcium intake
*   Increase citrate rich food such as lemon, orange juice etc
*   Decrease consumption of food rich in oxalates like spinach, nuts, beet root, potato chips, French fries
*   Avoid purine rich foods like animal protein, alcoholic drinks like beer

### Warning signs for immediate referral
*   **Anuria**
*   Fever with chills and rigors
*   Suspected renal failure
*   Persistent haematuria

### Medical Expulsive Therapy (MET)
*   Alpha blockers such as **Tamsulosin (0.4mg/day); Alfuzocin(10mg/day); Doxazocin(4mg/day); Silodocin(8mg/day)**
*   MET should be offered
    *   In Ureteric stones <10mm
    *   In the absence of infection, obstruction or deranged renal function
    *   MET can be tried for upto 4 weeks
