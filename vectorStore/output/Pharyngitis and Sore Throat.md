# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**PHARYNGITIS AND SORE THROAT**
ICD-10-J02

## CLINICAL SCENARIOS

Acute pharyngitis
may include a
spectrum of disease
varying from simple
viral pharyngitis to
dreaded neck space
infection.

Acute onset of throat pain with or without - Fever, tonsillo-pharyngeal exudates, **odynophagia**
and tender cervical **lymphadenopathy** is typically seen in bacterial pharyngitis.
Streptococcal (**GABHS**) pharyngitis is the commonest cause of bacterial pharyngitis

Rhinitis, conjunctivitis, skin or mucosal rashes point towards a viral etiology.
Pharyngitis and sore throat may be the initial symptoms in epidemics of flu

Sore throat followed by high grade fever, cough, drooling, lymphadenopathy,
breathing difficulty suggest **Epiglottitis** or **Laryngotracheobronchitis**,
especially in pediatric patients

An adherent membrane extending beyond the tonsillar confines with
toxaemia suggests **Diphtheria**

Pharyngitis with generalized lymphadenopathy is consistent with **Infectious
Mononucleosis (IM)**

Smoking and GERD are common causes of non-infective pharyngitis

## CLINICAL EXAMINATION

### PRELIMINARY
*   Temperature chart: fever is usually absent or low-grade in viral pharyngitis
*   Check for vitals/signs of dehydration due to compromised oral intake due to **odynophagia**
*   Complete oral and oropharyngeal examination with tongue depressor
*   Palpate for cervical and generalized lymphadenopathy
*   Rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis are potential systemic complications of streptococcal pharyngitis
*   Hepatosplenomegaly can be found in IM
*   A sandpapery scarlatiniform rash may be seen in **GABHS** infection whereas maculopapular
    rashes are seen with various viral infections and with IM empirically treated with penicillin

| CLINICAL FEATURES               | CENTOR SCORE | UNLIKELY TO HAVE GABHS | LIKELY TO HAVE GABHS | REQUIRE LAB TESTS TO CONFIRM GABHS INFECTION |
| :------------------------------ | :----------- | :--------------------- | :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Fever                           | 1            |                        |                      |                                                |
| Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy | 1            | Score = 0-1            | Score = 4            | Score = 2-3                                    |
| Tonsillar exudate               | 1            |                        |                      |                                                |
| Absence of cough                | 1            |                        |                      |                                                |

DESIRABLE
Assess
Centor
criteria
and
ascertain
its
score

RED FLAGS
*   Generalized
    lymphadenopathy
*   Cardiac murmurs
*   Purulent
    productive cough
    with tachypnea
    suggestive of LRTI
*   Hot potato voice
*   Unilateral tonsillar
    enlargement
*   Tonsillar
    membrane going
    beyond its
    confines
*   Agranulocyosis
*   Epidemic of flu

ESSENTIAL
INVESTIGATIONS
OPTIONAL
DESIRABLE
Throat swab for culture, routine hemogram including **GABHS rapid antigen detection test (RADT)**
total and differential leukocyte counts and peripheral
Lab tests to rule out EB Virus, Coxsackie virus,
Herpes virus, fungal or Gonococcal pharyngitis
smear to look for atypical lymphocytes (seen in IM).

## MANAGEMENT

### PHC / PRIMARY LEVEL

DISTRICT HOSPITAL
1.  Assess the patient for signs of toxicity, epiglottitis or oropharyngeal abscess
2.  Ensure vitals/hydration of the patient
3.  Saltwater gargle, warm liquids, and rest may be helpful in relieving symptoms
4.  Ibuprofen or Paracetamol is recommended for analgesia
5.  Antibiotic therapy:
    a.  Patients positive for all 4 Centor criteria to be treated with antibiotics without waiting for antigen testing or cultures
    b.  Patients with Centor score of 2&3 to be treated with antibiotics only if antigen testing or throat swab culture is positive
    c.  Patients with Centor score of only 1 not to be treated with antibiotics
    d.  Amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d in 2-3 doses orally) for 10 days is the first choice for GABHS infection. For patients who are
        sensitive for penicillin group, Erythromycin or Azithromycin is the antibiotics of choice
6.  Parenteral antibiotics (Ceftriaxone/cefotaxime) and steroids are to be started when the airway is compromised due to suspected
    epiglottis/Croup.

Management of
complication
e.g.
*   Deep neck
    space infection
*   Diphtheria
*   Epiglottis
*   Croup

## FOLLOW UP SERVICES

Recurrent (more than 7 episodes in previuos year or 5/year in last two years or 3/year in last 3 years) tonsillitis episodes need to be evaluated for
tonsillectomy.

**KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES**

GABHS: Group A Beta Hemolyticus Streptococcus
## ABBREVIATIONS
GERD: Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease
LRTI: Lower Respiratory Tract Infection
EB: Epstein Barr
RADT: Rapid Antigen Detection Test
