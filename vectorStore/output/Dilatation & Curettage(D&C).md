# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for
**DILATATION AND CURETTAGE (D&C)**

• Mostly done for gynaecological indications, but may also be considered in early pregnancy complications.
•
traditional **D&C** in gynaecological cases, it still has a place when other modalities are not available or do not yield adequate tissue

**CONTRAINDICATION**

**Acute pelvic and vaginal infections**

**WHERE CAN IT BE PERFORMED?**
• In secondary or tertiary healthcare centres preferably where facilities for anaesthesia and operation theatre are available to deal 
with procedure related complications, if any.
• Endometrial aspiration biopsy is usually done as an outpatient procedure in non pregnant cases.

**PRE- OPERATIVE REQUISITES**
* Presence of a valid indication
* General medical fitness & no contraindication
* A written informed consent
* **ANESTHESIA (ANY OF THE FOLLOWING)**
    *  • General anesthesia • Regional anesthesia • **Paracervical block** with **1% xylocaine** • **IV sedation** • **IM/** oral analgesia
 Strict asepsis to be maintained. **Antibiotics** to be used judiciously and decided as per need of individual case.
**ALL TISSUE REMOVED MUST BE SENT FOR HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION**

**POST PROCEDURE CARE & FOLLOW UP**
• Observe the patient for minimum two 
hours after the procedure for haemorrhage 
or any other symptoms or signs of 
complications prior to discharge 
• Patient can be discharged as soon as she is 
comfortable and alert. 
• Most common side effect is abdominal 
cramps which can be managed by oral 
analgesics.
• Warning signals to report back are to be 
explained at the time of discharge - severe 
pain, bleeding, foul smelling discharge or 
fever.
• Follow up is done after a week with 
histopathology report for further advice. 

**COMPLICATIONS**
• Excessive bleeding
• Cervical laceration
• Perforation of the uterus
• Injury to bowel and 
bladder 
• Pelvic infection
• Post-operative intra 
uterine adhesions

**DOʼS**
• Evacuation of urinary bladder 
before procedure.
• Safety checklist
• Dorsal/**lithotomy** position
• Bimanual pelvic examination 
prior to the procedure 
• Sounding to measure 
uterocervical length ONLY in 
non pregnant women.
• Sample to be sent for 
histopathology and 
microbiology (where 
indicated)
• REFER in case of a 
complication

**DONTʼS**
• Over abduction of legs 
• No sounding in cases 
of pregnant uterus.
• No forceful insertion of 
any instrument 
• Abandon the 
procedure in case of 
suspected perforation 
and refer to higher 
centre.
• Insertion of the dilator 
should be just beyond 
the internal os and 
NOT till the fundus

**COUNSELLING IS AN IMPORTANT ADJUNCT TO MANAGEMENT**

**KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES**

**D&C** is a blind procedure and may miss the pathology in some cases. In cases where focal pathology is suspected, tissue should be 
obtained under hysteroscopic visualization.
