• To be suspected in fractures resulting from trivial trauma or fall from a standing height or less
• For example **fracture neck of femur**, **forearm fracture (Colle's)**, **vertebral fracture**

|                     |                     |                     |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Postmenopausal females** | **Family history of fracture** | **Previous history of fracture** |
| **WHAT TO ASK?**   |                     |                     |
| **Renal stone disease**   | **Pancreatitis**  | **Steroid abuse or alternative medications or clinical stigma of cushing's** |

## INVESTIGATIONS
**Biochemical:**
Fasting serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline
phosphate and albumin (if available) hemogram
myeloma-proteins in serum or urine
Fasting blood glucose PTH (parathyroid)
25 hydroxy Vitamin D, IgA tTg
Renal function tests, bone markers beta cross LAP

**Bone imaging:**
DXA scan osteoporosis T score-osteoporosis > -2.5 severe
osteoporosis= fracture or T score > -3.0
X-ray of fracture site Use Z score for age less than 50 for
men and premenopausal women
X-ray lumbar spine (Lateral), pelvis (AP), skull (lateral),
both hands

Ultrasound abdomen, gall stones, renal stones and nephrocalcinosis, Ultrasound neck, enlarged parathyroid
Sestamibi scan for parathyroid enlargement

|                                 |                               |                                              |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Fracture neck of the femur      | L4 Osteoporotic fracture      | Sestamibi Scan for parathyroid adenoma      |

## HOW TO TREAT?
Resuscitate the patient if needed
Stabilize the fracture

## WHEN AND WHERE TO REFER?
|                                                         |                                                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Refer to **orthopaedician** for **fracture management surgical management** | Refer to **endocrinologist** for **evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis** |

## TREATMENT
• Daily oral calcium 1-1.5 gm/day
• Vitamin D supplementation to maintain serum
250HD levels of 30.0-50 ng/ml
Stop smoking alcohol
• **Inj Zoledronic acid 5mg I/V infusion** OR
• **Inj Denosumab 60mg S/C every 6 months** OR
Inj rPTH 20 µg S/C daily for maximum 2 years

## ABBREVIATIONS
CKD: Chronic kidney disease
CLD: Chronic liver disease
rPTH: recombinant Parathyroid hormone
