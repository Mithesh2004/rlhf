# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of
**ASTHMA**
ICD-10-J45

## Symptoms
*   Classic symptoms
    *   Recurrent/episodic **wheezing**
    *   **Breathlessness**
    *   **Cough** and/or **chest tightness**
*   Supportive features
    *   History of **atopy**, family history of **asthma**, presence of triggers, presence of **rhonchi** on chest auscultation
    *   No alternative explanation for these symptoms

## Try and Rule Out
*   Other obstructive airway disorders - see Table 1 for features that favour **asthma** over **COPD**
*   Other mimics - presence of fever, constitutional symptoms, purulent sputum, hemoptysis, focal chest signs on physical examination, foreign body aspiration, abnormal chest radiograph, etc.

## Approach to Diagnosis
*   Clinical assessment is the mainstay
*   Airway obstruction, and bronchodilator reversibility, on **spirometry** (if available) may support diagnosis
*   Refer patients for further work-up if diagnosis is in doubt

FEV1 Forced Expiratory Volume in first second, PEF Peak Expiratory Flow

## Guiding Principles
*   Mainstay of pharmacotherapy: **Inhaled drugs**
*   Frequency of symptoms determine treatment initiation (see figure 1 for details)
*   Reassess at 3-4 weeks - good response: in favour of asthma diagnosis
*   Patient education for compliance, warning signs, triggers, inhaler technique, PEF monitoring
*   Inhaler technique to be monitored
*   Follow-up at 4-12 weeks, assess diseases control by clinical parameters (see Table 2)
*   Step-up or step-down treatment as per level of asthma control (see figure 1)
*   Follow up three-monthly and modulate treatment as needed
*   Refer for further evaluation and management if asthma remains poorly controlled

## Disease Exacerbation

### Severe Acute Asthma (Patient to Be Admitted)
*   Inability to complete sentences, agitation, use of accessory muscles, respiratory rate >30/min, heart rate >110/min, pulsus paradoxus >25 mm Hg, silent chest, and/or room air sPo2 <92%
*   Oxygen supplementation to maintain sPo2 92-95%
*   Nebulized levosalbutamol/ipratropium (1.25 mg/0.5 mg) three doses at 20-minute interval, then 4-6 hourly or as needed
*   Injection hydrocortisone 200 mg intravenously, then oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg daily for five days
*   Refer if no improvement
*   Discharge only when symptoms improve, wheezing absent or significantly reduced, heart rate <100 bpm, respiratory rate <30/min, room air sPo2 >94%
*   Schedule follow-up outpatient visit at one week

### Non-Severe Acute Asthma
*   If none of the above features present - manage on outpatient basis
*   Continue additional inhaler doses as needed
*   Oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg daily for five days
*   Schedule follow-up outpatient visit at one week

**KEEP A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES**

### When to Suspect Exacerbation
*   Suspect if acute symptomatic worsening, or reduction in PEF to below 80% of personal best, while on continued treatment
*   Take two additional puffs of the inhaler used if symptoms persist, and repeat if needed
*   If no response after 24 hours, or symptomatic worsening, or further reduction in PEF, contact physician
*   Physician to assess severity of exacerbation and manage accordingly

### Life-Threatening Exacerbation
*   Altered sensorium, orthopnea, cyanosis, paradoxical breathing, hypotension, and/or bradycardia (heart rate <60 bpm) - immediately refer to higher centre with ICU facility
