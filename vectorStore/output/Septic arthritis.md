# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
**SEPTIC (PYOGENIC) ARTHRITIS**
ICD-M00

## SYMPTOMS

*   Fever with pain,
swelling and
inability to move the
joint

*   Malaise and/or
listlessness, irritability,
poor feeding,
immobility and joint
dysfunction

## SIGNS

*   Swelling, erythema,
tenderness, painful
limitation of joint motion,
painful limp

*   Patients may or may not
appear acutely ill or toxic
(especially malnourished/
immunocompromised
patients)

## ASSESSMENT

*   Detailed medical
history to look for
primary focus of
infection
including history
of antecedent
mild trauma

## INVESTIGATION

### Essential

*   Hemogram with ESR
*   C-reactive protein (CRP)
*   Blood culture
*   Joint fluid aspirate for examination
(Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic
culture and sensitivity (C&S) testing)

### Optional

*   Serum Procalcitonin
*   CE-MRI (contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging)

### Desirable

*   Plain radiographs of affected joint
*   Ultrasound of affected joint
*   Doppler to rule out DVT
*   Renal and liver function
*   ELISA serology for HIV, HBsAg, HCV
*   Blood sugar (FBS, PPBS/RBS)
*   Synovial fluid for fungal and
mycobacterial staining with C&S for
suspected cases
*   Synovial fluid for polarising microscopy
*   Synovial fluid examination for synovial
sugar and protein levels

## WHEN TO SUSPECT
**SEPTIC ARTHRITIS**

*   Cloudy or purulent
synovial fluid:
Synovial fluid white
blood cell count
>100,000 cells/mL
(neutrophils > 90%)
and Gram's staining
*   Synovial fluid glucose
level 50 mg/dL less
than serum glucose
levels

## MANAGEMENT

### Clinical impression of septic arthritis

#### Primary Care

Refer immediately to higher centre after:
1.  Adequate analgesia
2.  Immobilisation of the part
3.  First dose IV broad spectrum antibiotic (only if access
to higher centre will take more than 2-3 hours)

#### Higher Centre

*   Same as above, plus
*   Joint aspiration for Gram stain + C&S
*   Radiograph and ultrasound of affected joint
*   IV antibiotic to be continued, change according to
C&S report
*   Surgical treatment as mentioned below
*   If requiring repeated surgery or atypical organism
obtain specialist's consultation
*   IV antibiotic to be continued for two weeks,
followed by oral antibiotics for four weeks
*   Conversion to oral antibiotics based on
    1.  Clinical improvement
    2.  Fall in inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR levels to
be monitored every 2 days during hospital stay)
    3.  And resolution of systemic symptoms
*   Consult with microbiologist whenever available
*   Manage complications like DVT, osteomyelitis,
pathological fracture

### No definite alternative diagnosis

#### Primary Care

Refer immediately to
higher centre after:
1.  Adequate analgesia
2.  Immobilisation of
the part

#### Higher Centre

*   Same as above, plus
*   Aspirate and
investigate joint fluid
Radiograph of
affected joint

### Definite alternative diagnosis

#### NOT SEPTIC

*   Inflammatory arthritis
*   Crystal arthritis
*   Haemarthrosis
*   Trauma
*   Bursitis or cellulitis
*   Transient synovitis

Treat as appropriate

#### Septic arthritis

*   Treatment as per septic
arthritis protocol
