ABBREVIATIONS

 DRAIN THE ABSCESS BEFORE IT DRAINS A LIFE

## SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
*   Pain
*   Fever
*   Weight loss
*   Anorexia
*   Local tenderness
*   Organomegaly

## WHEN TO SUSPECT?
*   Patient having unexplained fever especially with chills and rigors
*   Local pain: Right hypochondrium (**liver abscess**), left hypochondrium(**splenic abscess**, pelvis (post operative status)
*   Post operative patient developing fever and increased leucocyte count

## INVESTIGATIONS
### ESSENTIAL
*   CBC
*   CRP
*   ESR
*   USG Abdomen
### DESIRABLE
*   LFTs
*   HIV serology
*   HBs Ag
*   Contrast enhanced CT study of the abdomen

An abscess forms like a round to irregular collection within the liver parenchyma or other abdominal organs/peritoneal cavity
A: Liver abscess
B: Subdiaphragmatic abscess
C: Peri renal abscess 
D: Peripancreatic abscess 
E: Splenic abscess

An axial CT scan image of the upper abdomen showing a peripancreatic collection (arrow)

An axial CT scan image of the lower abdomen in a post cholecystectomy patient showing multiple collections (arrows)

## MANAGEMENT
*   Medical management
    *   Send the aspirate for microbiological analysis but don’t defer treatment for the result of the same
*   Drug dosages: 
    *   Inj Metronidazole 500mg IV 6-8 hourly plus inj Ceftriaxone 2gm IV OD for 10-14 days (for liver and splenic abscess)
    *   For pancreatic and pelvic/lower abdominal abscesses:
        *   Meropenem 1-2gm IV 8 hourly plus Levofloxacin 500-750mg IV daily and Ofloxacin 200 mg for 5-7 days
        *   Cefoperazone 1000-2000 mg plus Sulbactam 500-1000 mg (as a combination) IV BD for 5-7 days
*   Surgical management:
    *   To be done in cases of ruptured/impending rupture into the pericardium, peritoneal cavity and pleural cavity
*   Options include:
    *   Laparotomy
    *   Chest tube placement/Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)

## IMAGE GUIDED DRAINAGE
Involves Ultrasound/CT guided placement of catheter in the abscess cavity 
Consider image guided drainage if the patient has the following despite medical treatment:
*   Persistent leucocytosis
*   Signs of septicaemia: tachycardia, hypotension
*   Impending signs of abscess rupture on imaging

### INDICATIONS
*   Patient developing tachycardia and hypotension
*   Persistent leucocytosis
*   Impending signs of rupture of abscess into adjacent cavity(pleural/peritoneal/pericardial)

### CONTRAINDICATIONS
*   Uncorrectable coagulopathy
*   Vital structures in the approach path (large vessel, bowel)

*   Days of required hospitalisation: 2-5 days
*   Expected outcome:
    *   Relief in pain and tenderness within 6-8 hrs
    *   Resolution of fever within 24 hours
*   Associated adverse events that may occur:
    *   Vasovagal syncope (manifested as sweating, hypotension, bradycardia and loss of consciousness)

### COMPLICATIONS
*   Injury to vessels in vicinity of the abscess
*   Injury to the pleura in case of liver and splenic abscesses

How to prevent vasovagal syncope: Ensure the following
*   Reassure the patient about the procedure
*   Place a large bore(18G/20G) IV cannula in the arm before the procedure
*   Keep normal saline infusion bag ready
*   Atropine IV to be available for use

How to treat vasovagal syncope
*   Raise the legs of the patient to prevent peripheral venous pooling
*   Inject Atropine 0.6 mg IV if the heart rate is < 60/min (usually responds to this otherwise the same dose can be repeated after 5 min)

WHEN TO TAKE OUT THE CATHETER: 
*   When the output is < 10 ml/24 hours

*   Immediate step to be taken if warning signs (as shown in red flag) occur: Clamp the drainage catheter (Do not take it out), fast fluid infusion to be started
*   Steps to be taken once complication is recognised:
    *   Appropriate imaging to look for source of bleeding (CT angiography followed by DSA if necessary)
    *   CT thorax if pleural breach is suspected

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Treatment of an abscess depends on its: 
*   Location
*   Size
*   Degree of clinical symptoms (patient with septicaemia {tachycardia, hypotension} should be treated aggressively whereas a stable patient can be discharged on oral medical treatment)

### LIVER ABSCESS
*   Right upper quadrant pain
*   May present with pleuritic right sided chest pain
*   Tender hepatomegaly on examination

### PELVIC ABSCESS
*   Deep seated pelvic abscess
*   Common in post operative patients after bowel/ gynaecological surgeries
*   Tender lower abdomen/ signs of peritonitis on examination

### PERIPANCREATIC ABSCESS
*   Upper abdominal pain
*   Patient usually has underlying acute/acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis

### SPLENIC ABSCESS
*   Left upper quadrant pain
*   Tender Splenomegaly on examination
*   **RED FLAG SIGN** - May deteriorate rapidly if splenic vein thrombosis occurs

POST PROCEDURE WARNING SIGNS SIGNIFYING COMPLICATIONS
*   Frank blood in the drainage tube (haemorrhage)
*   Drop in BP with tachycardia (haemorrhage)
*   Patient developing breathlessness/desaturation (pneumothorax)

opinions and available scientific evidence. There may be variations in the management of an individual patient based on his/her specific condition, as decided by the treating physician. There will be no

G: Right iliac fossa/ periappendiceal collection

CBC: Complete Blood Count
CRP: C-reactive protein
HBs Ag: Hepatitis B surface Antigen

## ALGORITHM FOR IMAGE GUIDED ABSCESS DRAINAGE

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Patient with abdominal pain, high grade fever, malaise (suspected intra abdominal abscess)] --> B(Laboratory and imaging investigations (Ultrasonography and CT) to confirm the diagnosis)
    B --> C{Abscess volume > 100ml};
    C -- Yes --> E{Superficially located liver abscess at risk of rupture into pericardium/peritoneum};
    E -- Yes --> F[Percutaneous image guided drainage of abscess];
    C -- No --> D{No improvement/Patient develops signs such as increasing abdominal pain, tachycardia, hypotension};
    D -- Yes --> F;
    D -- No --> G[Start medical treatment];
    E -- No --> D;
    F --> H{Symptoms resolve after 3-5 days};
    H -- Yes --> I[Continued medical Treatment];
