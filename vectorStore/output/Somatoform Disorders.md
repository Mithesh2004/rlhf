## DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

### INITIAL ASSESSMENT
*   Detailed clinical examination - to rule out any medical illnesses which might explain the symptoms
*   Complete history of the onset of all symptoms, exacerbating and relieving factors
*   Assessment for any other psychiatric illness such as depression or anxiety disorders

### PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT

2.  Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms
3.  Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns

C. Although only one somatic symptom may not be continuously present, the state of being symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months)
