# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
# INTERTROCHANTERIC FEMORAL FRACTURES
ICD-10-S72. 14

## DEFINITION
**Extracapsular fractures** of the proximal femur that occur between the **greater and lesser trochanter**

## RISK FACTORS
*   **Osteoporosis**
*   **Advancing age**
*   **Increased number of comorbidities**
*   **Increased dependency with Activities of Daily Living (ADL)**

## SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS
*   **Severe pain** in the hip after fall/Road Traffic Accident (RTA)
*   **Limb in a deformed position** (usually external rotation)
*   **Unable to move and stand on the injured limb**
*   **Bruising and swelling** around the hip
*   **Tenderness at trochanteric level**

## MANAGEMENT

### AO CLASSIFICATION
AO/OTA type-31-A pertrochanteric fractures:
*   31-Al fractures - simple
*   31-A2 fractures - multifragmentary -
    *   A2.1: detachment of the lesser trochanter
    *   A2.2: several intermediate fragments including the lesser trochanter
    *   A2.3: several intermediate fragments extending more than 1 cm distal to the lesser trochanter
*   31-A3: fractures - fracture line through the lateral femoral wall, anatomically defined as the lateral femoral cortex distal to the greater trochanter

### FIRST AID
*   **Pain relief**
*   **Immobilisation** of limb (splintage including hip, knee and ankle to minimize movements at fracture site during transport)

### RADIOGRAPHS
*   X ray pelvis with bilateral hips- AP
*   Involved hip with thigh – AP and lateral

### OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT
The mainstay of treatment is **fixation with a dynamic hip screw (DHS) or proximal femoral Intramedullary nail**
*   **Stable FRACTURE** -intact posteromedial cortex- Association of osteosynthesis (Ao) type Al and A2.1 -DHS
*   **Unstable FRACTURE** - broken posteromedial cortex- Association of osteosynthesis (Ao) type A3 & A2.2 & A2.3 Proximal femoral Intramedullary nail

### ARTHROPLASTY - INDICATIONS (RARE)
*   Revision for failed internal fixation
*   Associated pre-existing severe hip arthritis
*   Severely osteoporotic bone that is unlikely to hold internal fixation

#### Red flag signs
**Excessive Bruising/hematoma or any distal neurovascular deficit**

### Nonoperative treatment
Nonoperative treatment to be considered in patients with severe comorbidities not fit for surgery understanding high risks of pneumonia, urinary tract infection, decubitus ulcers, deep vein thrombosis and mortality
