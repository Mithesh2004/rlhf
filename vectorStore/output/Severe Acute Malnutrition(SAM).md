# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW) for the Management of SEVERE ACUTE MALNUTRITION WITH COMPLICATIONS ICD-10-E43

## WHEN TO SUSPECT?
*   Not exclusively breastfed for 6 months
*   Faulty feeding
*   Bottle feeding
*   Delayed/Inadequate complementary feeding
*   Poor appetite
*   Not gaining weight
*   Lethargic
*   Disinterested in surroundings
*   Delayed development

### Additional symptoms of complications
*   Loose motions
*   Jaundice
*   Seizures
*   Inter-current infections:
    *   Pneumonia
    *   Diarrhea
    *   Sepsis
    *   Skin infections
*   Severe dehydration
*   Untreated tuberculosis
*   HIV
*   Social challenges

## DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR SAM & MAM

*   0-6 months
    *   Consider SAM if MUAC <11.0 cm
*   6-59 months
    *   Consider SAM if MUAC <11.5 cm or WHZ <-3 SD or bilateral pitting oedema
    *   Consider MAM if MUAC is between 11.5-12.4 cm or WHZ is between -2 to -3 SD
*   >5 years
    *   Consider SAM if BMI ≤ 3SD (severe thinness)
    *   Consider MAM if BMI ≤ 2 SD (thinness)

## EXAMINE FOR

*   Vital signs: PR, RR, CRT
*   Lethargy/irritability
*   Loss of subcutaneous fat
*   Muscle wasting
*   Pallor
*   Signs of Vitamin B, K and A deficiencies
*   Respiratory distress
*   Dehydration

## TRIAGE

*   SAM + GOOD APPETITE + NO MEDICAL COMPLICATION
    *   Home based treatment + oral amoxicillin 50 mg/kg/dose twice a day for 7-10 days
*   SAM + COMPLICATIONS/POOR APPETITE/ FAILED HOME TREATMENT
    *   Hospitalize

## INVESTIGATIONS

### ESSENTIAL
*   Hemogram, RBS, LFT, KFT, Chest X-Ray, RDT-HIV, Gastric aspirate for CBNAAT/AFB

### DESIRABLE
*   ECG, Stool pH, Stool microscopic, Urine culture, Serum electrolytes (Na, K, Cal), Serum B12, Serum Folate levels

### OPTIONAL
*   Blood Culture, Blood gases, Ultrasound (inferior vena cava to ascending aorta ratio)

## TREATMENT

### A. STABILISATION PHASE:
Monitor vitals, urine frequency, stool/vomitus volumes
**INTAKE:** IVF (DNS) 4 ml/kg/hr for 2-3 days with early/concomitant initiation of oral feeds (130 ml/kg/day)

Failure to gain at least 5g/Kg/day for 3 consecutive days on catchup diet.

APPETITE TEST: Passed if, a child not fed for last 2 hours, when fed by mother in a quiet place consumes in 1 hour:
*   7-12 months: of ≥ 25 ml/kg of F100
*   \> 12 months: of locally prepared ready to eat food **
AMOUNT TO BE GIVEN: 15 gms or more if < 4 kg; 25 gms or more if 4 - 7 kg; 35 gms or more if 7-10 kg
**[ Mixture of Roasted groundnut 1000 gm, Milk powder 1200 gms, Sugar 1120 gms, Coconut oil 600 gms. To be kept refrigerated for not more than 1 week.]
