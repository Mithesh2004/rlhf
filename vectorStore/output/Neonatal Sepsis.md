# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
SEPSIS IN NEONATES
ICD-10-P36

Assess every neonate
born in or brought
to a health facility
for presence of
sepsis, at admission
and during hospital
stay, by looking for
red and yellow flag
signs and risk factors

## RED FLAG SIGNS
*   **Seizures**
*   **Lethargy**
*   **Shock**
*   Hardening of skin so that it cannot be pinched off the underlying tissue or bone (look at cheeks and thighs)
*   Bleeding from multiple sites
*   Respiratory distress onset more than 6 hrs after birth
*   Respiratory distress needing intubation or Silverman's score >6
*   If age of baby is less than 7 days and mother has foul smelling discharge or chorioamnionitis

## YELLOW FLAG SIGNS
|                      |                                                       |                         |                     |                        |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------- |
| **Refusal to feed**   | **HR>160 persisting for one hour despite normal temperature** | **New or increased apneic episodes** | **Respiratory distress** | **Floppiness**          |
| **Feed intolerance** |                                                       |                         |                     | **Fever or hypothermia not due to environmental temperature** |

**Any of the maternal risk factors: If age of baby is less than 7 days and mother has**

| **Dai handling or unclean vaginal examination** | **Rupture of membranes ≥18 hrs** | **pPROM** | **Urinary tract infection** | **Diarrhea** | **Fever** |

## HIGH PROBABILITY OF SEPSIS
Start treatment and investigate
*   Any **RED flag sign** is present
*   Two **YELLOW signs/maternal risk factors** are present
*   One **YELLOW sign or maternal risk factor** is present AND baby's gestation at birth is ≤ 32 weeks

### Admit in the NICU/SNCU
*   Obtain blood sample for culture and sensitivity
*   Start empirical antibiotics as per local/unit policy pending reports
*   Provide supportive care and do appropriate laboratory investigations as indicated clinically (Chest X-ray, CBC, platelet count, RBS, serum electrolytes, renal functions)
*   Perform lumbar puncture (LP) for CSF analysis when baby is hemodynamically stable

## AT-RISK/SUSPECT SEPSIS
Observe
*   One **YELLOW sign** or **maternal risk factor** is present AND
*   Baby's gestation at birth is >32 weeks

### Keep baby under close observation for 48-72 hrs
*   Start antibiotics if another yellow/ red sign appears during observation
*   Obtain sample for blood culture and sensitivity before starting antibiotics
*   Perform LP for CSF analysis if starting antibiotics or if the blood culture is positive

## REVIEW AT 48 HRS

### SIGNS OF SEPSIS DISAPPEARED AND CRP <12 MG/L
*   Stop antibiotics
*   Keep under observation till blood culture is reported as sterile after 48 hrs of incubation

### SIGNS OF SEPSIS IMPROVING BUT STILL PRESENT
*   Continue antibiotics
*   Antibiotic duration based on blood culture and LP report

### SIGNS OF SEPSIS WORSENED, OR A RED SIGN APPEARED AFTER STARTING TREATMENT
*   Upgrade antibiotics as per antibiotic local/unit policy
*   Antibiotic duration based on blood culture and LP report

If antibiotics are continued, review again at 5 days: If baby is now well from last 48 hrs, blood culture is sterile and CSF is normal: Stop antibiotics

If blood culture was not done, a negative CRP or Procalcitonin at 24-48 hrs after starting antibiotics, can help in early stopping of antibiotics

## DURATION OF ANTIBIOTICS
| CONDITION                                                             | DURATION |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| Pneumonia                                                             | 5-7 DAYS |
| Sepsis with CRP >12 mg/L AND sterile blood culture AND normal CSF analysis | 5-7 DAYS |
| Blood culture positive                                                  | 10-14 DAYS |
| CSF suggestive of meningitis                                            | 21 DAYS    |

## REMEMBER
*   Do not start antibiotics without indication. Clinical features in neonates are non-specific. Looking for alternative reasons for sickness and careful serial observations are important ways to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics.
*   Believe a negative blood culture report and stop antibiotics if baby has recovered.
*   Main utility of both CRP and procalcitonin is to rule-out sepsis. A positive test may also be due to several non-infective conditions. Therefore, a positive CRP or procalcitonin should be interpreted carefully giving due weightage to clinical course of the baby.
