# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
## HIP OSTEOARTHRITIS
ICD-10-M16.9

## SYMPTOMS & SIGNS
*   Pain
    *   During or after movement
*   Joint stiffness
*   Tenderness
*   Loss of flexibility & restricted range
    of hip movement
*   Grating sensation
*   Deformity

## PRIMARY
*   Very rare

## MANAGEMENT

## SECONDARY
*   Developmental dysplasia of hip
*   Osteonecrosis
*   Failed reconstruction
*   Post-traumatic
*   Tuberculosis
*   Coxa plana (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease)
*   Slipped capital femoral epiphysis
*   Paget's disease
*   Hemophilia

## CONSERVATIVE MEASURES
*   Weight loss
*   Non-opioid analgesics (as per
    need)
*   Reasonable activity
    modification
*   Avoid standing for long hours,
    climbing stairs, squatting,
    sitting cross legged
*   Hip abductor and extensor
    muscle strengthening exercises
    and quadriceps exercises
*   Ambulatory aids like walking
    stick

## KELLGREN (1963) DESCRIBED 4 GRADES OF HIP ОА
*   Grade 1 (doubtful OA), Possible narrowing of the joint space medially
    and possible osteophytes around femoral head

*   Grade 2 (mild OA), Definite narrowing of the joint space inferiorly,
    definite osteophytes and slight sclerosis

*   Grade 3 (moderate OA), Marked narrowing of the joint space, slight
    osteophytes, some sclerosis and cyst formation, and deformity of the
    femoral head and acetabulum

*   Grade 4 (severe OA), Gross loss of joint space with sclerosis and cysts,
    marked deformity of the femoral head and acetabulum, and large
    osteophytes

## INDICATIONS OF TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT (THR)
*   Patients with osteoarthritis of hip, Kellgren & Lawrence Grade-IV with following clinical features may require
    surgery after appropriate conservative treatment has failed
*   Deformity & pain that significantly limits the activities of daily living
*   Disabling hip pains that continues even at rest
*   Daily requirements of analgesic
*   Bilateral ankylosis of hip joints

## ABBREVIATIONS
OA: Osteoarthritis
THR: Total Hip Replacement
