# Standard Treatment Workflow (STW)
LEFT TO RIGHT SHUNT LESIONS
ICD-10-Q21.8

Department of Health Research
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India

INTRODUCTION 
* Most common type of **congenital heart defects**
* One of the common causes of infant morbidity and mortality
* Majority of the lesions are easily correctable if detected on time

PHYSIOLOGY
* Left to right shunt lesions lead to passage of oxygenated blood from left side of heart to right side and into the lungs
* As a result there is increased flow to the lungs and over circulation of blood within the lungs and left side of the heart
* Majority of symptoms of shunt lesions are due to this over circulation

COMMON LEFT TO RIGHT SHUNT LESIONS
* **Pre-tricuspid shunts:**
◦ **Atrial septal defect (ASD):** Usually asymptomatic. Presents commonly as incidentally detected murmur
* **Post-tricuspid shunts:**
◦**Ventricular septal defect (VSD)**
◦ **Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)**
◦ **Aorto-pulmonary window (APW)**

Large post-tricuspid shunts present early (usually by 1.5-2 months of age) with signs of cardiac failure like feeding and breathing difficulty along with failure to thrive

WHEN TO SUSPECT?
1. **Failure to thrive** (weight less than 3rd centile for age, drop in weight by more than 2 major centile lines)
2. **Feeding difficulty** (suck-rest-suck cycle) with forehead sweating (cold sweats)
3. **Repeated chest infections/one life threatening infection**
4. **Baseline tachypnea** with subcostal and intercostal retractions: 
* Rate > 60/min in less than 1 year old 
* Rate > 50/min between 1-2 year old
5. **Tachycardia:** 
* Rate > 160/min in less than 1 year old 
* Rate >140/min between 1-2 year old
6. **Bounding** (high volume) pulse (in PDA and APW)
7. **Precordial bulge** with active precordium
8. **Loud second heart sound**, gallop rhythm, ejection systolic murmur, mid-diastolic murmur (Large shunts may not have loud murmurs)
9. **Hepatomegaly**
10. **Dysmorphic features**: Down syndrome are known to be associated with **Atrioventricular septal defect(AVSD)**
11. **Abnormal peripheral pulses** especially feeble lower limb pulses

INVESTIGATIONS
*Essential
* X-ray Chest, Echo
* ECG - To watch for unexpected abnormal axis, rate, rhythm and QRS complex
* CBC, Electrolytes - Depending on clinical conditions and specific clinical circumstances 

MANAGEMENT
Timely referral to higher centre with pediatric cardiac facility
* Shunt lesions are confirmed by echocardiography 
* Large post tricuspid shunts require early referral

Drugs
* **Furosemide**: 1-2 mg/kg/dose twice or thrice daily (reduce or temporarily stop during diarrhea or vomiting). Oral suspension contains 10 mg/ml. So can be given as 0.1 ml/kg/dose twice or thrice daily
* Add **Spironolactone** if **Furosemide** is administered more frequently than once daily 
* **Digoxin**: 5 microgram/kg/dose twice daily. Oral preparation contains 50 microgram/ml. So can be given as 0.1 ml/kg/dose twice daily

General Advice
* Educating parents about importance of maintaining hygiene to prevent infections
* Promoting breastfeeding if tolerated. If breastfeeding is difficult then teach gavage/spoon feeding, preferably with expressed breast milk
* Use top milk in case of reduced breastmilk output. Average volume intake should be approximately 120 mL/kg/day
* Include energy dense weaning foods in those beyond 6 months of age
* Continue vaccination as per Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) schedule
* Vitamin D3, calcium and iron supplementation to be continued as per IAP recommendations and clinical requirement
